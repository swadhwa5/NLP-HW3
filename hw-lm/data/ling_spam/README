Here is some information from the paper:

The benchmark corpus that we constructed is a mixture of spam messages
and messages received via the Linguist list, a moderated mailing list
about the profession and science of linguistics. The corpus, dubbed
Ling-Spam, consists of 2893 messages:

- 2412 Linguist messages, obtained by randomly downloading digests
  from the list's archives, breaking the digests into their messages,
  and removing text added by the list's server.

- 481 spam messages, received by the first author. Attachments, HTML
  tags, and duplicate spam messages received on the same day were not
  included.

Spam messages are 16.6% of the corpus, a figure close to the incoming
spam rates of the authors, and rates reported in (Sahami et al. 1998)
and (Cranor & LaMacchia 1998). 

Although the Linguist messages are more topic-specific than most users
incoming e-mail, they are less standardized than one might expect
(e.g. they contain job postings, software availability announcements,
even flame-like responses). Hence, useful preliminary conclusions
about anti-spam filtering can be reached with Ling-Spam, until better
public corpora become available. With a more direct interpretation,
our experiments can also be seen as a study on anti-spam filters for
open un-moderated mailing lists or newsgroups.
