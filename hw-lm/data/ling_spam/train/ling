<subject> ipa vs americanist symbols </subject> i am at last drawn to reply to the debate on ipa versus ' americanist ' traditions in phonetic transcription . i was , frankly , somewhat surprised by the tone of the original submission , suggesting that the ipa 's refusal to use hachek / wedge symbols for palatoalveolars was an example of racism ( both anti - americanism and anti-slavicism , and no doubt anti - diacriticism ) . now we learn that the ipa itself is an anti-democratic conspiracy , and we need a new campaign led by american organisations to make phonetic transcription 's afe for democracy , apple pie , and the american way ' ! ? a couple of points need to made in this regard , i think . first , it is not true that the ipa is not used in north america . what we have here is maybe not euro - centrism , but phonology / dialectology centrism ! clinical phoneticians and speech pathologists in north american nearly always use the ipa ( yes : long esses / zees , jods , and the cardinal vowel system , and all ! ) indeed , some departments of linguistics / phonetics operate within the ipa tradition ( e . g . university of victoria bc ) . on the other hand , virtually all phonologists on this side of the atlantic use the so-called americanist symbols . the divide , therefore , is not as has been portrayed . if phonologists tend to use one set of symbols , and phoneticians another , is that really such a problem , as often they are concerned with different levels of description anyway ? even if phoneticians cannot agree , is this also such a problem ? can raising the fears of racial discrimination and undemocratic conspiracies really be justified over relatively trivial distinctions in symbols that anyone trained in the area knows about anyway ? the second point concerns the debate on the symbols themselves . as i have just noted , the difference between certain symbols is surely not a fundamentally important one ; but i would like to speak in defence of the ipa non-hachek versions . leaving aside the fact that these symbols do have a long history , i ( do ) feel that a unit symbol is preferably than a composite one . ( unlike the original posting , it always seemed obvious to me that the hachek symbols were s / z etc plus a diacritic ) . granted that the ipa is not always consistent on this point , a unitary symbol approach avoids confusions as to the nature of the s - s distinction . one may have to counter students ' feelings that [ s ] is really only a type of [ s ] which is reinforced by the spelling ; it does n't help if the symbol looks also like a 's ort of s ' . we might also look at the difference with [ j ] versus [ y ] for the palatal approximant . on the surface , this looks fine , as the [ y ] spelling is familiar ( but surely anglocentric , and not in line with slavic / germanic etc usage ? ) . however , this choice then leaves us with a problem for a high front rounded vowel . if we can't use [ y ] then we must resort to [ u " ] . the diacritic [ " ] , however , is also commonly used in many traditions to stand for centralized . this transcription also suggests that [ u " ] is a variety of [ u ] , and that [ o " ] is a variety of [ o ] etc . the use of independent symbols leaves open the relationship between lip-rounding and tongue position , which the 'd iaresis ' versions do not . however phonetic transcription develops in the future , let 's avoid throwing around accusations at other users or bodies . utopian schemes of universal orthodoxy in this area are surely unneccessary if not unsound . to be realistic , most ipa users ( wherever they ' re based ) are unlikely to surrender over a century 's worth of patterns of usage , and non - ipa users will be equally keen to keep to their symbolizations . let 's learn to live with this , and spend instead time on refining transcription systems ( e . g . for the transcription of atypical speech found in speech pathology clinics ) . perhaps , vive la difference is the motto to aspire to ! martin j . ball university of ulster
<subject> re : 6 . 199 ipa </subject> it would be nice to have true democracy when trying to reach agreement on how to use phonetic symbols , as stemburger has suggested . just as war is too important a matter to be left to the generals , so choosing a standardized set of symbols should n't be left to the phoneticians . the international phonetic association has always recognized this . it is fully conscious of the fact that ipa symbols are used by a wide variety of people . at the 1989 kiel convention , which was the first major revision for almost 50 years , there was a great deal of discussion about remembering our ' customers ' , as one phonetician put it . and ( despite comments to the contrary by participants in this discussion ) the only changes since then have been small changes that affect comparatively few users of the alphabet , largely because of the belief that it is important for the alphabet to remain as stable as possible . if stemburger would like to organize some kind of referendum , good luck to him . i note that he suggests the lsa as the appropriate body for the u . s . , although he also mentions ashla ( american speech hearing and language association ) as an interested group that has officially adopted the ipa . their membership is much larger than the lsa . the asa ( acoustical society of america ) is another group that has many members interested in phonetic symbols . the1989 ipa kiel convention was open to all , and did include members of all the organizations mentioned by stemburger , including lsa , ashla , asa , sil and others , none of the participants , of course , speaking officially for any of these organizations . the convention was also publicized in a paper in language , the only paper that morris halle and i have ever co-authored . i really do not see how we can get more international collaboration . agreeing on symbols is as difficult as getting everyone to use the same units for measuring weights and distances . in response to my previous suggestion that people interested in choices of phonetic symbols should join the international phonetic association , i have received inquiries as to how to do this . there is a form in the journal of the international phonetic association ( which members receive - - and your university library + should + take ) . but really all you need to do is to send your name and address , plus a check for $ 25 or # 13 sterling ( or request to charge access / mastercharge / visa / eurocard ) for the annual dues to : secretariat , ipa linguistics and phonetics univeristy of leeds leeds , ls2 9jt , u . k . peter ladefoged

<subject> latvian language policy </subject> i have found the topic of " linguistic human rights violations " particularly interesting , but i am a little confused as to what constitutes such a violation . marc picard writes , " personally , i would hope that latvians would take any measures they deem necessary to get everybody in their country to speak their language . " if someone were to issue such a statement about the language situation in the united states ( particularly with regards to native speakers of spanish who are residents / citizens of the us ) , i am sure that some group would throw up its arms in protest of the oppression of this segment of the population . is this what is meant by a " linguistic human rights violation " ? is it something more severe ? or are we looking at other countries and applying different standards than those which we apply in the united states ? mark mitton carleton college northfield , mn 55057 mittonm @ carleton . edu

<subject> dick armey 's slip and correction </subject> i was curious if anyone was actually interested in verifying whether armey 's slip was actually a slip . but since someone has asked what the time delay between the utterance of " barney fag " and his correction : having heard a replay , i would say the delay was less than a second . imo , the utterance was definitely a slip and not a slur . other factors would support this conclusion , apart from the delay , phonology , etc . , primary among them the fact that armey is n't stupid . he 's a ph . d . in economics , and has the political savvy to get himself elected majority whip . only the politically ( or linguistically ) tendentious would be likely to assert that someone of his political skills would think it to his advantage to make such an utterance . what a shame it was to see members of this list anxious to use their professional skills ( or to abuse them ) in order to make a political point . two weeks into this discussion and only now does anyone actually inquire into the data . it makes one wonder how much linguistic research is driven by other agendas , and what the quality of that research is . . . dave wharton

<subject> referencing example numbers in wp </subject> since the question has been raised about how to reference example numbers in wordperfect for dos , here 's my two-cents ' worth about wp5 . 1 and wp6 for dos . in 5 . 1 , although one could use paragraph numbers , as was suggested , this precludes using them to number sections of a paper . a better approach is to use the numbering facilities for " graphics boxes . " like paragraph numbers , graphics boxes can be referenced by the cross-reference feature in wp . what you have to do is set equation box options so that the caption is to the left of the box ( the default is to the right ) . for phonological rules , which can be nicely formatted using the equation editor , you then create an equation box with a caption consisting of " ( [ box number ] ) " and go into the equation editor to write the rule . for sample sentences , etc . , the box itself is empty , but with a caption as before , and set to allow text to overlap it . you can then exit the create graphics box screen and proceed to type the examples . the numbers automatically update as new boxes are added . cross - referencing is done by assigning name to any example you want to reference ( as a cross-reference target ) and then putting in a cross-reference reference code with the target 's name . you have to generate occasionally to update the reference numbers ; they initially appear as ? . in wp6 ( which is superior for linguistics because of its support for phonetic symbols ) it 's even easier . wp6 has a counters feature ( in the character format dialog box ) . you define a counter ( i call mine example ) . whenever you want to insert an example , you type ( in the main document screen ) the open parenthesis , go into the counters dialog box , and push f8 ( or click on the increment and display button ) . this inserts two codes : one to increment the number ( this is not done automatically for user-defined counters ) and one to display it . cross - referencing is done as before . a couple of additional wp tips : - the styles feature is very useful for dealing with in-text stylesheets for journals . for any feature where journals have different styles ( scare quotes , sentence glosses and translations , in-text reference punctuation , etc . ) you assign a style . styles can be any combination of characters and codes . for each journal , you create a different style library . then , if you want to change formatting from one to another , you simply read in a different style library . - the above is too simple for bibliography style sheets , where the order of elements differs in addition to punctuation and font attribute . if you are comfortable with programming , you can write merge programs ( called primary merge files in wp5 . 1 and merge form files in wp6 ) for the different stylesheets and have a bibliography file which is formatted as a secondary merge file ( wp5 . 1 ) / merge data file ( wp6 ) , with fields for things like author 's first and last names , year , title , etc . ( include a field for type of reference ( book , article , dissertation , etc . ) since the format of the title may vary . ) this is not recommended for computerphobes , however . - lining up foreign language examples with word-for - word glosses in proportional fonts can be done using tabs , and resetting the tab stops for each example . this is easier from wp6 . 0b onwards ( if you have a mouse ) because of the ruler feature : you display the ruler and drag the tab stops , and as you drag them a dotted line extends down from the tab stop through the text so you can see exactly where you are . in previous versions , you have to go into the tab set menu and play with the tab settings by trial and error . it is even possible to put asterisks inside the space of the tab between the example number and the example . instead of tabbing , use the tab align ( wp5 . 1 ) or decimal align ( wp6 ) feature ( ctrl f6 ) . before pressing ctrl - f6 , set the " decimal character " to the first letter of the example ( on the other format menu in 5 . 1 and the character format menu in 6 ) . to prevent the spell-checker from stopping on words in foreign examples ( or phonetic representations , or logical formulae ) , in 5 . 1 you can use the language feature to insert a made-up language code . the spell-checker will complain that it can't find the dictionary for the language , and you tell it to ignore the language and continue checking what it can . in wp6 a block can be marked [ speller / grammatik off ] ( on the other format menu ) to prevent it from being spell - or grammar-checked . - - yehuda n . falk department of english the hebrew university of jerusalem " live long and prosper " - vulcan greeting
<subject> summary : c - insertion </subject> some weeks ago i posted a query as to whether anyone knew examples of consonant insertion to separate impermissible vowel clusters , in which the choice of consonant was not conditioned by its surrounding vowels . thanks who all those who responded . their names and e-mail addresses appear with their edited remarks . i would welcome further comments on anything brought up in this summary . reason for the query : my query was prompted by work i ' ve been doing on the czech verb system in which , in certain forms from certain paradigms , a glide / j / appears that is not present in other forms . ( since most e-mail won't support czech diacritics , i ' ll spell all czech forms phonetically . an apostrophe after a consonant indicates its palatalization . ) typical of such verbs is the verb [ d ' elat ] " to do " : [ d ' ela : ] " he / she / it does " [ d ' elaji : ] " they do " [ d ' elaji : c ] active participle ( plural ) in old church slavonic and in russian , this / j / appears in all persons of the present tense in related paradigms ( e . g . , russian [ d ' elajet ] " to do " 3rd per . sing . ) and creates a vjv sequence , which historically contracted into a long vowel in czech ( e . g . , [ d ' ela : ] ) . in most current phonological accounts of west slavic languages , such as rubach ( 1993 ) , this / j / is considered to be present underlyingly , but then needs to be deleted in almost all forms of these verbs . this representation seemed too abstract to me , and when i considered czech phonotactic restrictions ( see charts in palkova ( 1994 ) ) from an autosegmental viewpoint , it occurred to me that the / j / ( where it does survive ) may simply be inserted to break up impermissible v clusters or to prevent formation of overlong syllable nuclei . the only sticking point in this was that / j / often appears between non-high vs or vs with which it shares no obvious features . as i found out from the responses and from searching i ' ve done since , the epenthesis of consonants between non-homorganic vowels is not as uncommon as one might assume . so far , the norm seems to be that cs inserted at morpheme boundaries will be glides ( even between non-high vs ) unless there is a relic consonant that has been retained , and sometimes analogically extended , in a given environment . in all cases i ' ve found where the inserted c is a relic , that c is coronal . more data would be greatly welcome . the responses : albert ortmann ( ortmann @ sapir . ling . uni-duesseldorf . de ) mentioned several examples : english intrusive / r / , french t-epenthesis in interrogative forms , dutch insertion of / j / and / v / between non-high vs morpheme internally ( e . g . , theater [ te : ' ( j ) a : t @ r ] ; zovals [ zo : ' ( v ) als ] " like , as if " ) , and swiss german insertion of / n / between certain hosts and clitics ( e . g . groesser wie-n - i " taller than - ep - i " ) . = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = subj : vowel clusters from : spscob @ main . queen-margaret - college . ac . uk from : spscob @ main . queen-margaret - college . ac . uk x - from : spscob @ main . queen-margaret - college . ac . uk ( dr james m scobbie ) some people might think that / r / sandhi in english is of the type you are looking for , but really / r / is just the consonantal glide counterpart of non-high vowels , so it 's just like finding / j / near / i / or / w / near / u / . note , however , that to avoid inserting / r / in certain socially stigmatised environments , many speakers insert glottal stop : law [ ? ] and order instead of law [ r ] and order = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = subj : c - insertion from : seegmiller @ apollo . montclair . edu ( steve seegmiller ) karachay , a turkic language , has a clear case of a consonant appearing under certain circumstances involving what would otherwise be v - v sequences . the plural suffix is - le or - la ( depending on vowel harmony ) , so that at ' horse ' has the plural atla . however , if the plural suffix is itself followed by another suffix beginning with a vowel , an - r - appears : atlari " m ' my horses ' .

if the final syllable of the stem is heavy ( that is , if it ends with a long vowel or a diphthong ) , then - aa is suffixed , an epenthetic [ w ] being added . the infinitives ashakataa / a = shaka-ta - aa / ( 0 = get . off - tt-inf ) " to get off " y cheecheewaa / cheechee-aa / ( soft - inf ) " to be soft " illustrate this contrast . = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = thanks again to all who responded . i 'd welcome more examples if anyone knows of any . james kirchner jpkirchner @ aol . com
<subject> re : 6 . 249 dick armey 's slip and correction </subject> i ' m sorry if this was in the original post , but it seems obvious to me that phonological misprocessing is not the only possible type of " slip " we could be dealing with , indeed , i do n't know the " speech error " literature all that well but " fak " for " frank " seems totally out as a likely error , in my view ( has anyone looked at the phonological context ? ) . surely the suspicion must be that this is a privately used slur of representative frank that crept into public discourse - - i . e . , it was a register problem rather than a phonological one . it would seem unfortunate ( just to respond to the " political agenda " part of an earlier post ) if we as linguists refused to bring our competence to bear on questions such as this for fear of being " politicized " . mark
<subject> re : 6 . 249 dick armey 's slip and correction </subject> could someone provide the context for dick armey 's utterance of " barney fag " ? i only heard it once and did n't write it down . my impression at the time , however , was that the phonological environment did n't seem quite right for a spoonerism . one other thought : it seems that a binary opposition between an intentional slur on armey 's part and a purely phonological slip does n't represent all the possibilities . it 's certainly possible that if the string " barney fag " has been used often enough on capitol hill in the hearing of dick armey , he might very well have inadvertently substituted it for frank 's actual name . is n't that something that 's done all the time : accidentally saying something that one has heard recently or repeatedly . " can't get that tune out of my head ! " seems like a reasonable explanation for a " slip " that was n't a spoonerism . anything on non-spoonerism phonological slips out there that bears on this ? phil gaines
<subject> dick armey 's slip </subject> so dave wharton , having determined that the delay between richard armey 's " barney fag " remark and its correction lasted less than a second , is confident that it must have been " a slip and not a slur " ( presumably blameless ) , all the more since armey has a ph . d . and a wealth of political savvy and " would not think it to his advantage to make such an utterance . " a victim , then , of linguists with ulterior agendas . how in the in the world is one to respond to such a statement ? if wharton had made the suggestion 75 years ago you might repeat the observation that freud offered in the introductory lectures to the effect that the merely somatic or phonetic concommitents of slips can't explain why they occur when they do - - as he put it , it 's like telling a policeman that the darkness of the night and the isolation of the street have caused your purse to be snatched . what might have possessed armey , then ? the new republic has pointed out that he was one of only forty-seven members ( gingrich was not among them ) who voted against george bush 's hate crime statistics act , which allowed the government to record violence against homosexuals ; that he voted to exclude people with aids from the americans with disabilities act ; that he voted to deny government funds to groups that boycotted the boy scouts of america on the grounds of that organization 's anti-gay policies ; and that he refused to sign a voluntary statement saying that his own office did n't discriminate against homosexuals . of course the remark was n't " intentional , " but the evidence is pretty thick that armey harbors just the sorts of inner demons who would have been lying in wait for any breach in conscious attention . most inhabitants of the late 20th century will acknowlege some acquaintance with pesky creatures like these , and you would think that it would be only by an act of willful repression that someone could deny their existence entirely . but maybe we should give wharton the benefit of the doubt ; maybe his is a genuine victorian innocence . only , just think of it ! all those theorists arguing that we are living the twilight of modernist era , when there are still people ( with an " edu " in their address , yet ) on whom it has not even begun to dawn .
<subject> re : 6 . 249 dick armey 's slip and correction </subject> having read all of the research literature on slips of the tongue and having scanned them in both normal and aphasic corpora , i find it hard to believe that this much discussed slip was linguistic tho it may , in some sense , have been freudian . bob wachal
<subject> re : 6 . 249 dick armey 's slip and correction </subject> slurs . . . i mean , sirs : armey 's slip could very well have been a slip , but a slip of this sort represents a competing plan , and one can then ask , why the competing plan ? phonological similarity ( " similarity " being the aristotean catch-all ) [ / fraenk / vs . / faeg / ] or something more like bernie baars 's " unintentional " pun , clearly indicating something a bit more than raw phonological similarity . the non-phonological , competing plan notion brings up all sorts of interpretive issues concerning why armey may or may not have had something painfully abusive " on his mind " when he produced " fag . " if it had been " on his mind , " it was ( at that point in time during on-line speech ) not anything typically volitional and intentional . these are tricky issues .

) - does the signer get the audiences attention ? ) - is the story well structured ? ) - is the story within the time limits set ( usually 3 minutes ) ? ) - does the signer keep to the rules ? ) this usually consists of - no dirty jokes . ) - no overzealous religious contexts . ) ) the competitior must give a title to his / her story and state its type , ( ie true ) story , joke story , sad story , not true story etc . . . ) ) ) if the story exceeds the time limit a point is deducted . however the signer is ) not interrupted if he / she exceeds the limit but is allowed to complete the ) story ( unless it really is too long ! ! ! ) . ) ) sometimes , at the end the winner ( if he / she is popular with the audience is ) asked to repeat it or give another story ) . ) ) . . . sign-singing is not too common among the deaf community far as i am ) aware . it is mostly done in religious situations . i think it is n't a strong ) component of deaf culture . however story-telling is a strong part of deaf ) culture and especially of making jokes and light-hearted teasing . anyway thats ) my deaf experience here in new zealand . ) from karina bingham ( karina @ uhunix . uhcc . hawaii . edu ) : ) there is an african - american a cappella group called " sweet honey in the ) rock " who have a full-time signer in the group . she performs with them and ) signs her interpretations of the songs . they recently published a book ) for their 25th anniversary : ) ) reagon , bernice johnson . the long journey home . 1994 . ) ) in which the signer discusses her experiences in the deaf community and ) a deaf church ( where the congregation sang in sign ) . her parents were both ) deaf ; she is not . ) from marina mcintire ( mmcintir @ lynx . dac . neu . edu ) : ) you have inadvertently touched upon a very tender issue in the deaf ) community here in the us . first , let me say that only in the us have i ) seen this phenomenon . brits ( both deaf and hearing who work with them ) ) are confounded and amused by it . in the us , it used to be quite the ) thing to translate songs and develop routines to go with them , produce ) recitals and concerts , and the like . it arose , most likely , out of a ) strong church-related tradition of " helpers " for deaf people . ) ) in the last ten to fifteen years , however , deaf people have begun their ) own liberation . song - signing has been a casualty , by and large . it is ) viewed as representing one aspect of a pathological or clinical view of ) deafness , i . e . , that the worst " loss " resulting from deafness is music . ) this is , of course , far from the truth . and for culturally deaf people , ) music is a peculiarity belonging to the mainstream hearing world and of ) no consequence in their lives whatsoever . so * that * motive ( helping ) d / deaf people appreciate what they ' re missing ) is not acceptable . ) ) another complaint is that , by and large , translations are more ) influenced by the rhythm of the music than by any sense it might make in ) asl , presenting d / deaf audiences with nonsensical or distorted versions ) of signs and signed syntax . this arises partly , of course , out of the ) difficulty of translating any poetry into any language . ) ) worst of all , and perhaps most puzzling to d / deaf people , is the ) insistence of most song-signers on including things like " tra la la " or ) humming . there is * nothing * that could make less sense to a d / deaf ) audience ! ) ) i will say that i have seen some wonderful song-sign translations done , ) including some with rather elegant dance routines . sometimes these have ) been done by d / deaf people and sometimes by hearing folks . by and large , ) however , this practice is no longer an acceptable pasttime in our ) community . exceptions are made , ironically , for interpreters who work in ) theater . musical productions , because of their general inclusion of ) dance ( a more interesting visual event ) and costume / props / etc . . . are ) quite popular and well-attended ( comparatively speaking ) by d / deaf ) theatre-goers . many thanks to all those who replied . randy lapolla institute of history and philology academia sinica
<subject> dependency grammar : corrections , reactions , reformatting </subject> apparently i made a few mistakes in the posting about my manuscript on dependency grammar . this is curious , because i apparently got everything right on the earlier posting on the same topic to the dg and hpsg lists . at least two people have informed me that they successfully ftp-ed everything , but at least two others have had problems . the address should be : julius . ling . ohio-state . edu the suffixes . ps . gz on the file-names ( not the address ) indicate that they are compressed , so you need to uncompress them using the command ' gunzip ' . the slashes in the directory address should be ' / ' and not ' \ ' . presumably because of some sort of software error , i cannot read things in my inbox . but i put three of the reactions to my previous posting there before i had grown accustomed to this problem , so i cannot answer these directly , but will now try to do so through the linguist list . to the respondent from finland : you wanted a numerical address . it is : 128 . 146 . 172 . 200 to the respondent from taiwan ( or was it hongkong ? ) . you noted a problem with chapter 7 . the general problem has now been corrected , but there may still be a problem with one or two of the examples . if so , i can send an ascii file , as you suggested , or a paper copy of these examples , if you send me a regular mail address , but in either case you have to write to me again . i am now used to reading my mail and replying if necessary , or at least writing down the essential information , before downloading . nevertheless , i hope the compuserve people solve the problem soon . to the " computer illiterate / dyslexic " ( your own term ) : surely you can find someone there who is able to help you with the ftp procedure . the university you are at must have more than its share of experts in this area . but i can also send you an ascii version of chapter 1 via email , if you write to me again . for the sake of making my files more compatible with the software linguists most often use , andreas kathol has advised me to reformat my manuscript in latex . unfortunately , he does n't know where to get a latex software packet for use with pcs ( what i use ) . can anyone help by giving me a site to ftp from ? i am in the process of creating a latex version of the files . dan maxwell 100101 , 2276 @ compuserve . com

<subject> sum : verbal / pronominal feature differences </subject> earlier this month i posted the following query : = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = what languages ( if any ) do people know about , where there are distinctions carried in the verbal morphology which cannot be indicated in the pronominal system ? ( for example , if a language expressed gender differences in the verbs , but not in pronouns ) . = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = the following people very kindly replied with various pieces of very useful information : antton elosegi aldasoro ( fvpelala @ sd . ehu . es ) ariel mira ( mariel @ ccsg . tau . ac . il ) " ellen l . contini - morava " ( elc9j @ faraday . clas . virginia . edu ) simon corston ( corston @ humanitas . ucsb . edu ) brian d joseph ( bjoseph @ magnus . acs . ohio-state . edu ) june wickboldt : jwickbol @ ucs . indiana . edu here are the replies : the two most promising examples of what i was asking about come from basque and hebrew , where the pronominal and verbal systems do not match for gender : - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - antton elosegi aldasoro ( fvpelala @ sd . ehu . es ) in basque there is not gender at all in nouns or pronouns , but some verbal forms carry the distinction of the gender of the 2nd person nik ekarri diat nik ekarri dinat i ( erg ) give it to you-masc i ( erg ) give it to you-fem antton elosegi ( university of the basque country ) ariel mira ( mariel @ ccsg . tau . ac . il ) in my own hebrew " normal " verbal inflections ( past and future ) distinguish person gender and number in 2nd and 3rd persons , but only number in 1st person . so far so good , because so does the free pronominal system . however , our now present tense is morphologically a nominal form ( for eg . holexet = ' walk ( fem ) ' as well as ' walker ( fem ) ' . now , our nominal forms , having nothing to do with pronominal forms inflects for number and gender , but does not distinguish persons . the result is that now 1st person present inflection distinguishes between fem and masc though the independent pronoun does not . modern hebrew is losing some gender distinctions too ! 1 . future tense 3rd pers plural : fem form is hardly ever used . even the purist language academy has " abolished " the form . ( we do n't seem to ever have had it in past tense ) . 2 . in colloquial speech , the same is happening to 2nd person , no doubt because the 2nd and 3rd person plural fem forms are identical ( though not the masc ones they have converged with ) . 3 . this needs to be checked ! the free plural feminine pronoun , as well as past inflections of same seem to me to be shaking . but real data has to be recorded for this , so do n't make much of this . i wonder whether mixed forms are possible , namely , you-fem go + masc , etc . * and on a more theoretical note * : hopefully you will find very few examples for what you are looking , because i believe ( what others have been saying for about a hundred years ) that inflections tend to develop out of free pronouns . hence , the dependence between the meanings encoded , though there is no principled reason for the inflection to change later , i guess . it is really unlikely , though , because once the form is inflected , fused with the verb , chances are it won't develop its separate semantics . if you ' re interested in theories about the development of inflection out of pronouns , i have my own , which accounts for the well-known fact that inflections for 1st and 2nd person are much more prevalent than 3rd person . i claim this is so not because 3rd person is unmarked , but rather , since referents of 3rd person are usually much less accessible than referents of 1st and 2nd person ( the speaker and the addressee ) . minimal forms are reserved for more accessible referents ( in general ) , hence inflections are the natural development out of free pronouns for highly accessible antecedents . you can have a look at my book ' accessing np antecedents ' , routledge , 1990 , chapter 6 . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - the following two respondents quote cases where logophoric and obviative marking occur attached to the verb rather than to the pronoun to which they refer . to me , it seems that these particles are not inflections as such , though i am not sure exactly how i would classify them . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - june wickboldt : jwickbol @ ucs . indiana . edu some languages having logophoric reference mark the reference with verbal affixes , not pronouns or pronominals . two are newari , see karen ebert . 1986 . reported speech in some languages of nepal . in f . coulmas ( ed . ) direct and indirect speech , berlin : mouton de gruyter , and gokana , see hyman , larry m . and bernard comrie . 1981 . logophoric reference in gokana . journal of african languages and linguistics . 3 : 19-37 . brian d joseph ( bjoseph @ magnus . acs . ohio-state . edu ) the algonquian language cree , spoken in canada , has a category known in the literature as " obviative " , which provides a way of distinguishing between different third-persons in a discourse ( the first one mentioned is " proximate " , and the next one mentioned is " obviative " , so cree can distinguish unambiguously between " john met bill as he was walking down the street " where rhe " in english can refer to either john or bill - - in cree it would be unambiguously one or the other ) . for the most part , and this is where it is relevant to you , this marking shows up on the verb ( thus the verb form in the above sentence would be different if it was john walking or bill walking ) ; nouns can show obviative / proximate marking ( though one class , the so-called " inanimate " nouns do not ) , and there are proximate and obviative forms of demonstrative pronouns , but not of the personal pronouns . thus " wi : ya " is ' he / proximate ' as well as ' he / obviative ' . pronouns are not usually expressed in cree , but if you just look at the personal pronouns , then cree would be a language of the sort you were looking for . for that matter , these facts are similar in virtually all the algonquian languages , so it is n't just cree . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - finally , two respondents noted that independent pronouns are not necessarily marked for case in the same way as pronominal affixes . such phenomena do not seem rare to me ( e . g . arabic does the same ) . i am assuming then that such cases are not marked . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - " ellen l . contini - morava " ( elc9j @ faraday . clas . virginia . edu ) in swahili part of the verb morphology is subject and object prefixes , that signal info . about participant role with respect to the action of the verb . this distinction is not made among independent pronouns , which distinguish only person and number . but since the subject and object prefixes in swahili are often called " pronominal " , i do n't know if this counts as a distinction that can't be made by pronouns . simon corston ( corston @ humanitas . ucsb . edu ) in my ma , in press in the pacific linguistics series from anu , i discuss ' ergativity in roviana ' . roviana has special pronominal forms used for absolutive ( s ( 's ubject of intr ' ) or o ( ' object ' ) ) , and different forms for a ( 's ubject of tr ' ) . the pronouns make distinctions in person , number , and incl / ecl for 1pl . there are pronominal verbal affixes on the verb which are always only o . i . e . whereas the independent prons do n't distinguish s / o , the pronominal affixes do . somewhere around here i have a brief sketch of roviana which i have been sending to people . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - i found everything very interesting , and am happy to receive any more info on my query above . thanks again to those who responded ! maik gibson university of reading

<subject> addendum to coston 's object affixes </subject> in his summary of object affixes ( linguist list : vol-6 - 235 . fri 17 feb 1995 ) , simon corston observes : languages with object affixes but which lack affixes indicating other grammatical relations do occur , but would appear to be uncommon . that , however , really depends on what we mean by object affixes ( and subject affixes for that matter ) . so - called subject and object affixes fall into three types : ( i ) nonreferential / nonanaphoric agreement markers ; ( ii ) ' functionally ambiguous ' agreement markers ( i . e . functioning as both nonreferential / nonanaphoric agreement markers and anaphoric / referential markers depending on the context ) ( bresnan and mchombo 1987 ) ; and ( iii ) anaphoric or referential markers . the nuclear micronesian group provides an interesting case for the foregoing distinction . for instance , in woleaian , the subject markers are independent words , whereas the object markers are suffixes . but they are both functionally ambiguous agreement markers . in kusaiean , the subject and object markers are also independent words and suffixes , respectively . but they are all referential pronouns . for more detailed discussion of the nuclear micronesian languages see my paper : ' the verb - object bonding principle : with special reference to nuclear micronesian languages ' ( see refs below ) . if the complexity in subject and object affixes ( viz . the three types mentioned above ) is disregarded , probably corston 's observation may hold . but if only anaphoric / referential subject and object markers are taken into account , it may be a different story . in fact , in the same paper i have used a small convenience sample of 40 languages to ascertain whether the verb - object bonding principle ( as proposed in tomlin 1986 : ' a transitive verb and its object form a more cohesive , unified syntactic and semantic whole than do a transitive verb and its subject ' ) is evident in the pronominal system as well : e . g . object pronouns are more tightly bonded to the verb than subject pronouns are . the upshot of this investigation is that object pronouns ( e . g . affixes ) are more tightly bonded to the verb than subject pronouns ( e . g . independent words ) . this suggests that insofar as referential / anaphoric markers are concerned , ' languages with object affixes but which lack affixes indicating other grammatical relations ' may be crosslinguistically common , rather than uncommon . refereneces bresnan j . and s . mchombo 1987 . topic , pronoun , and agreement in chichewa . language 63 : 741-782 . givon , t . 1976 . topic , pronoun , and grammatical agreement . in subject and topic , ed . by c . n . li , pp . 149-188 . new york : academic press . tomlin , r . s . 1986 . basic word order : functional principles . london : croom helm . song , j . j . 1994 . the verb - object bonding principle : with special reference to nuclear micronesian languages . oceanic linguistics 33 . 2 ( in press ) . jae jung song university of otago new zealand
<subject> asl dictionary on cd-rom </subject> my recent query concerning the new american sign language ( asl ) dictionary on cd-rom generated a substantial response , both from this list and from slling - l . i have summarized the main points of these responses below . please bear in mind that i have not seen the products in question . the dictionary reviewed on pbs is the american sign language dictionary on cd-rom by martin sternberg and is distributed by harpercollins . the following is the positive point that recurs in people 's messages : - - it is at the moment the only published asl dictionary that includes motion videos of asl signs , which serves to disambiguate unclarities in printed representations . the following are the negative points that recur in people 's messages : - - the dictionary is based too heavily on english , being essentially an english - to - asl dictionary . this both makes it hard ( at times , impossible ) to get an idea of the internal structure of the asl lexicon , and makes it less useful to native signers . ( there is , however , some categorization into semantic groups . ) there are also more specific problems arising from the failure to make asl distinctions that are not made overtly in english ( e . g . english " lecture " is used as a headword , while the asl equivalent is specifically a verb , not a noun ; classifiers are almost completely omitted ) . - - the dictionary is based on sternberg 's book-form dictionary of the early 1980s , and fails to take account of recent developments in the study of asl . - - there may be technical quality concerns , but since i have n't seen the product i ' m not in a position to judge . it seems to work better on more modern machines , and the mac version seems to work better than the windows version . alternatives : the following other cd-rom asl dictionary projects were drawn to my attention : - - multemedia dictionary of asl ( mm-dasl ) , release planned for summer of 1995 . this dictionary is based generally on the work of william stokoe ( who is involved in the project ) . it allows direct lookup of asl signs , incorporates recent linguistic work on asl , and is assisted by a panel of native asl users . for details , please contact sherman wilcox , university of new mexico ( wilcox @ mail . unm . edu ) . - - asl dictionary on cd-rom developed by dennis cokely at linstok press , 4020 blackburn lane , burtonsville , md 20866 , and alpha and beta tested by ken rust at madonna university , who should be contacted for further details ( rust @ smpt . munet . edu ) . thanks to : jacqueline anderson , nancy frishberg , marian macchi , mark a . mandell , joyce mcdonough , chris miller , karen mistry , becky moreton , cindy neuroth - gimbrone , steve seegmiller , mark seidenberg , barbara sensiba , dan slobin , leslie h . stennes , sherman wilcox , and the authors of the many messages that were forwarded to me from slling - l . - - bernard comrie dept of linguistics gfs-301 tel + 1 213 740 2986 university of southern california fax + 1 213 740 9306 los angeles , ca 90089-1693 , usa e-mail comrie @ bcf . usc . edu
<subject> query on physical appearance of words </subject> content - length : 1535 we are a group of environmental scientists who have been pondering a question . has anyone done research on emotional responses to the * physical appearance * of words or groups of letters ? for example , ' toxic ' , 'd ioxin ' or the ' oxi ' combination . why do people have a fear of 'd ioxin ' but not ' furan ' ( another toxic chemical ) . obviously , some reaction is created by the media , but is there something else involved ? do certain combinations of letters ( e . g .

<subject> interim summary : anthropoid linguistic ability </subject> in linguist 5-1467 ( 18 dec . 1994 ) , i posted the following query : ) douglas h . chadwick , in his review of kanzi : the ape at the brink of the ) human mind , by sue savage - rumbaugh and roger lewin ( nytimes book review , ) dec . 11 , 1994 , pp . 15-19 ) , says , ) ) ) . . . this goes a long way toward countering the complaint that language - ) ) using apes are merely responding to cues from researchers or , at best , ) ) learning rote behavior to get rewards without really comprehending the ) ) meaning of the words they employ . . . . part of the problem is that the ) ) authors are playing by rules laid down by their critics . it was rene ) ) descartes . . . who fashioned the longstanding paradigm of animals as ) ) automatons [ sic ] , incapable of doing anything other than mindlessly ) ) responding to whatever forces impinge on them . descartes insisted that ) ) animals cannot even feel real pain or pleasure , much less understand or ) ) remember the experience . . . . in our era , this tradition has been carried ) ) on by linguistics experts equally intent on preserving language and rea - ) ) son for the exclusive use of humans . each time an ape demonstrates ei - ) ) ther ability , the linguists set about redefining language and reason in ) ) more complex and confusing ways , erecting yet more artificial barriers ) ) for primates to hurdle . ) ) excuse me , is this something i ' ve missed in my seven years of grad school ) and subsequent four years of professional activity in linguistics ? are ) we deliberately engaged in a dastardly plot to deny our anthropoid cou - ) sins their birthright ? psycholinguistics has never been one of my fortes , ) but i certainly do n't remember anything in the introductory survey cour - ) ses i ' ve taken myself or developed to teach to others anything so much as ) hinting that it is an a priori assumption of the field of linguistics ) that language is the exclusive prerogative of homo sapiens , only that ) it 's an important part of the package that defines that species . ) ) i remember enthusiastically inflated claims made back in the 50 's about ) the forseeable progress in computer technology - - predictions as to how ) quickly we would get computers that could not only converse with us in ) real time in some given human language ( default : english ) but whop any ) human being in chess as well . as all ai researchers know , it soon became ) clear that these predictions were based in part on an oversimplified ) notion of what constituted language ( if i remember correctly , some ) premises were on the level of edgar rice - burroughs ' endowing his heroes ) with a 's pectacular ability to master alien languages ' that consisted of ) an ability to memorize a dictionary ) . and i understand that many claims ) about ' ape language ' , and the rebuttals from the community of linguists , ) have been at similar levels . but it seems to me that this is quite ) different from the scenario in which the academic linguist , threatened by ) the physical anthropologist , mutters , ' hmm ; so far we ' ve felt safe with ) this definition of linguistic competence , but this chimp has mastered ) that . we ' ll have to change the definition if we want to avoid miscege - ) nation ! ' , which is apparently what chadwick is envisioning . ) ) now , i daresay there may be individual linguists who do react this way , ) just as in previous eras there were scientists who would from time to ) time redefine the standards of what constituted full humanity . or civi - ) lization , or what have you , to maintain the claim that whatever it was , ) the native peoples of africa and the western hemisphere did n't have it . ) but i certainly do n't , and i ' m not aware of any of my colleagues that ) do insist , as the sectional headline in the nyt book review has it , ' on ) keeping language and reason for humans alone ' ( i ' m also a little be - ) mused at this conflation of language and reason ; language has never ) struck me as an entirely ' rational ' process ) , much less that , as chadwick ) and , by derivation , said headline imply , that as a professional class we ) are unanimous in doing so . ) ) i ' m considering writing a letter to the editor to complain about this ; if ) anybody else has already done so , please let me know . but what i really ) want to know is , what is the current general consensus ( if there is one ) of ) the field on this subject ? are the claims in the savage - rumbaugh & lewin ) book anent kanzi 's linguistic ability valid ? or is some further clari - ) fication in order ? is it just that some researchers in this area have ) a ( perhaps understandable ) chip on their shoulder ? or is there a real ) conflict between theoretical linguists on the one hand and physical an - ) thropologists and primatologists on the other on this subject ? first of all , david pesetsky did write a letter to the new york times , which was published in the dec . 25 issue of the times book review , and i refer all interested parties to it ( for some reason , i can't find my copy at the moment ) . secondly , i 'd like to thank the following scholars who got in touch with me over the holidays to discuss this issue , discussion to be summarized below : john h . chalmers ( non12 @ cyber . net ) dick hudson ( uclrah @ ucl . ac . uk ) massimo piattelli - palmarini ( piattem @ dipsco . hsr . it ) tom j . pulju ( pulju @ ricevm1 . rice . edu ) harold schiffman ( haroldfs @ u . washington . edu ) discussion proceeded along two logically distinct questions : ( 1 ) what is currently the most accurate assessment of the ' linguistic performance ' , ( and , by inference , linguistic ability ) of the anthropoids ? ( 2 ) why are such people as the gardners , savage - rumbaugh , chadwick , etc . so irritated at us ? on the first question , all of my respondents , as well as david pesetsky , seem to be agreed that the most impressive ' linguistic ' performance of chimps and gorillas reported in the literature is at a level roughly equi - valent to that of a human child of approximately two years of age , but that the anthropoids seem to be unable to develop beyond that stage . in particular , they show no evidence for syntactic structure , nor for any ability to distance themselves temporally or spatially from the referents of their statements . i received statements such as the following : ' the most successful of the apes have managed to reach more or less the level of children in the two-word utterance stage . the size of the lexi - con is about the same , as is the combinatory ability . ' ' the apes master a refined system of communication , and are capable of some abstract thinking , but lack the very fundamentals of human language ( recursiveness , structure-dependency , parsing into constituents , etc . ) . ' ' the chimps mostly have a lexicon , and a rudimentary syntax that lets them distinguish between actor and patient , but that 's about all . . . . the chimps ( a ) have no morphology to speak of ( b ) can't use displacement of the message ( i . e . , can't talk about the past or future , or something that happens / ed in another location ) ' [ at a venture , i would guess that they can't handle contrafactuals either . ] ' it is claimed that the ape " utterances " lack grammaticality or syntax . the apes can make the correct symbolic associations , but have no sense of grammatical patterning . in two and three " word " sentences , the order of the elements is variable and each element maybe repeated any number of times in any order and independently of the rest ( sequences like give banana give kanzi kanzi banana kanzi give , etc . ) ' one of my respondents , partly on the basis of hanns own occasionally frus - trating experiences resulting from the geographical proximity of an insti - tution presumably devoted to the 's tudy ' of anthropoid language , made some critical statements about the scientific methodology of some of this research . in particular , after referring to hockett 's 16 'd esign fea - tures ' of language , hann remarks : ' the proponents ' claim that [ chimps ] do have cultural transmission , because washo taught her son , does n't bear up under much scrutiny ; washo had to be rewarded to learn every sign and her son has not learned as many , nor passed them on to any other chimp . i see what the chimps learned as the equivalent of a pidgin ; but creoliza - tion never took place . ' which implies ( 1 ) that anthropoid ' language ' ac - tually corresponds to the skinnerian model refuted by chomsky in his fa - mous review as regards human language and ( 2 ) that it is not sufficiently ' natural ' to the anthropoids for them to feel motivated to transmit it successfully . some of my respondents addressed some of the wider theoretical and metho - dological issues relevant to linguistics implicit in this discussion . one opined ' that some dismissal of ape language research is partly , and unconsciously , motivated by a turf-protection instinct . we ' re all alrea - dy uneasy about the fact that there are certain subfields of linguistics whose importance we acknowledge but which we ' re not personally terribly well-versed in . . . . i think many theoretical linguists breathed a sigh of relief when terrace announced that [ the chimp ] nim had n't really learned human language at all . it meant that they did n't have to worry about mo - difying their theories to fit ape language data . ' another said , ' most linguists do n't really care ( at least not consciously ) about whether apes can learn language as such , but they do care deeply about whether lan - guage is " sui generis " and innate or not . . . . as far as linguists are concerned , we ' re divided over chomsky 's claim that language is a geneti - cally-programmed module , rather than an area of knowledge which is han - dled by general cognition . if apes can't learn language at all , that supports the chomskyan view ( which presumably involves some cataclysmic mutation say 100 , 000 years ago , or at least since we split off from the other primates ) . if they can learn some of it , we have evidence for ge - neral cognition ( where apes are presumably less well endowed than us , so you 'd expect partial success ) . ' in further discussion we agreed that this argument only held if we accept a 's trong ' version of the relevant dichotomy implicit in the innateness hypothesis , according to which human linguistic ability is overwhelmingly if not completely independent of general human cognition . i pointed out that even if chimps are demonstrably distinct from us on a genetic level they still share over 98 % of our dna . so even if they share some of our linguistic ability it might mean that they also share some of the distinc - tive genetic endowment that provides it . a more effective test would be on cetaceans or pachyderms , which are nowhere as nearly related to us as chimps are but which appear to have roughly comparable cognitive levels . if they also share a certain amount of our linguistic ability , that would indicate that at least that amount is probably dependent more on general cognitive ability than on any specific genetic endowment . if chimps , dolphins , elephants , whatever , can't master human language but have other modes of communication * not isomorphic * with ours but of * comparable com - plexity and flexibility * , then this would give us the opportunity to stu - dy how much of human language is necessary to the general phenomenon of language and how much is incidental and of relevance only to our species ; it might also enable us to talk about the ' innateness ' of human linguistic ability in terms that would not be offputting to geneticists . on the second question , the basis for the irritation towards academic lin - guists on the part of the proponents of anthropoid language , there was some consensus that they were working with an overly simplistic concep - tion of what constitutes language , and were offended that we refused to share it . typical were the following remarks : ' all the [ proponents ] of animal language , and of its continuity with hu - man language , assume that human natural languages simply * are * the result of communication and use . . . . the basic design of human languages is * not * dictated by use , and we can easily conceive of species that would possess a * radically * different design for language and would communicate just as well , if not better . ' ' the gardners et al . have an extremely elementary grasp of what is real language . they think that if they have a lexicon and bare syntax , that 's all there is . their other argument , that the apes have " real " sign lan - guage , is also pitiful . . . . the approach trivializes both oral languages and sign languages . ' there was , however , some acknowledgment that some of the ' blame ' for this state of affairs belongs on our doorstep . the ' trivialization ' just men - tioned was claimed to be due at least in part to inadequacies in state - ments by linguists in the 50 's and 60 's . one respondent in particular pointed to an inveterate tendency to try to identify a single , defining , characteristic as the sine qua non of human linguistic ability , rather than accepting the fact that such important distinctions are often proper - ly made on the basis of mosaics of characteristics . in particular , much research in anthropoid ' language ' has apparently focussed on the ability of chimps and gorillas to coin novel expressions , unanticipated by their human teachers / handlers , on the basis of a finite number of memorized ' lexemes ' and some basic combinatorial principles . this effort has suppo - sedly been motivated by early assertions by academic linguists that what distinguishes human language from all other forms of animal communication is its creative ability . when the gardners , etc . , demonstrate that their apes are capable of similar creativity and we then say , ' very nice but that 's not language ' , they are understandably miffed . in response to this , i think what is necessary is greater tact , humility , and honesty on all our parts . we need to admit up front that we ( or our predecessors ) have oversimplified in the past , and give credit to the ape researchers for helping to elucidate the issues . and we need to make it clear that what chimps , gorillas , and two-year - old humans share is in some sense a * rudimentary * linguistic ability , but not equivalent to what adult humans do . in short , we need to increase everybody 's awareness of the inherent rich - ness and complexity of human linguistic behaviour , which to my mind means we need to devote more time and energy to introductory courses in general linguistics ! harold schiffman reports some encouraging success in this direction with a course on linguistic anthropology at the university of washington . further discussion on the issues raised here is welcome , either in perso - nal communication with me or in general discussion on the list . i hope in the not too distant to be able to post a short list of references to published literature on this subject . best , steven - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - dr . steven schaufele 712 west washington urbana , il 61801 217-344 - 8240 fcosws @ prairienet . org * * * * o syntagmata linguarum liberemini humanarum ! * * * * * * nihil vestris privari nisi obicibus potestis ! * * *
<subject> summary : " grasshopper mind " </subject> short answer : " grasshopper mind " is british english , not japanese - english . summary answer : thanks to those linguist readers who responded to my query ( 5 . 1431 , 94 / 12 / 11 ) about " grasshopper mind , " an expression that is entered into kenkyusha 's japanese - english and english - japanese dictionaries ( 1974 , 1980 ) and roget 's thesaurus ( 1982 ) , but apparently not found in any monolingual english dictionaries . the respondents , in alphabetical order , were : deborah milam berkley , marie egan , ted harding , steven schaufele , steve seegmiller , todd sieling , and stephen p . spackman . the inquiry asked four questions : ) do other english language reference works enter " the grasshopper mind " ? ) is it a varietal or dialectal term ? when was it first recorded ? are ) there analogous " grasshoppery " words in other languages ? ( 1 ) looking up " grasshopper mind " in english dictionaries is a lexicographical dead end . i ' ve checked dozens - - including old and new , standard and slang , uk and us , - - and not one enters it . some larger dictionaries record a derogatory sense of _ grasshopper _ ; e . g . , the new shorter oxford english dictionary ( 1993 ) : " 2 . _ fig . _ a person held to resemble a grasshopper in character or behaviour ; an inconstant , flighty , or frivolous person . l16 . " and the near-synonym " grasshopper brain " is webster 's third new international dictionary ( 1971 ) usage example for _ grasshopper _ meaning 3 . 2 " light and frivolous : untouched by care for the future . " ( 2 ) harding definitively answers the second question : ) " grasshopper mind " is well-known standard uk english usage . to say ) someone " has a grasshopper mind " means that their focus of attention ) jumps unpredictably from subject to random subject . none of the other respondents , including three widely-dispersed speakers of american english ( berkley , egan , seegmiller ) , had seen or heard this collocation , but all agreed they could readily understand what it means . in terms of _ grasshopper _ meaning ' frivolous , careless , ' the semantics of " grasshopper mind " are fairly self-explanatory . ( 3 ) dating the " grasshopper mind " coinage is moot . harding says : ) i ' m sure it 's not particularly recent in origin . . . . i ' m pretty sure it ) must be possible to trace early uses of the phrase " grasshopper mind . " sieling suggests checking aesop 's " the ant and the grasshopper , " and funk & wagnalls new standard dictionary ( 1913 ) defines _ grasshoppering _ as : " 1 . an unsettled and unsteady course of life ; improvident living : from the fable of the grasshopper and the ant .

" fire " here translates " launch a projectile " ) and " stick " is the classifier for a rigid rod . " rigid projectile ) launcher " is not so snappy , but a rather tighter word than " gun " ) do n't you think ? the semantically transparent " grasshopper mind " reveals a lexicographical gap between english dictionaries published in the united states and the united kingdom . while unknown to most american anglophones and familiar to many uk anglophones , lexicographers have overlooked this metaphor for orthopterous mentality . modern lexicography is benefiting from computerized corpora and machine-readable dictionaries . for instance , searching for adjectival _ grasshopper _ + noun combinations in cobuilddirect 's on-line corpus ( direct @ cobuild . collins . co . uk ) reveals three occurrences of " grasshopper mind , " two of " grasshopper warbler , " and one each of " grasshopper leap , " " weather , " and " nijinsky . " many dictionaries enter _ grasshopper warbler _ ( locustella naevia , characterized by its buzzing call ) but none _ grasshopper mind _ . further research is necessary . any information about this expression 's historical origins or distributional usages ( seegmiller asks about australian english ) would be gratefully welcomed . michael carr , otaru university of commerce , otaru 047 japan email carr @ canal . otaru-uc . ac . jp fax 81 + ( 0 ) 134-22 - 0467

<subject> language policy </subject> admittedly , i ' m coming in on the middle of this discussion , having missed the earlier messages . however , i was struck by m . hale 's disturbing feelings about " references to such ( non-linguistic ) issues as " citizenship " and " ethnicity " " . how can you manage a language planning project without taking into consideration such non-linguistic factors , in addition to a study of language attitudes , government policies past and present , language of education and social mobility , etc . etc . ? and something else to think about perhaps . . . while the language planner ( s ) might not favor legal restrictions outright , the legal promotion of a language or languages , which seems like the opposite course , could actually lead to unofficial restrictions of the other language ( s ) . someone mentioned the case of spanish and english in the us . last week i heard a radio ( npr ? ) news report that some monolingual english speakers can't find work in the miami area because they do n't speak spanish ( the report was in reference to a politician 's support of making english the official language of the us ) . at a national / federal level , one could argue that spanish is a minority language ; at a local / city level , one could argue that it is not . do we have here a case of the promotion of spanish leading to unofficial restrictions on english - speakers , at least at a city level , in terms of employment opportunities ? my point is that the definition of " minority language " is going to depend on the specific situation . i am currently involved in a small-scale language planning project ( in the capacity of director ) and the toughest decisions i come across have to do with the " non-linguistic " factors : the people , the emotions , the feelings and the ideas they have towards the other people who do n't speak their language . even a small project is extremely complex . deborah du bartell , ph . d . linguistics program edinboro university of pennsylvania edinboro , pa 16444 usa 814-732 - 2736
<subject> words that are their own op </subject> regarding words that are their own opposites i ' ve thought of an example - the word 's hame ' in aboriginal english and standard australian english . for example , in the paul kelly ( standard australian english ) song , " special treatment " he describes an aboriginal boy who has had his family 's history hidden from him ( pushed off land , put in chains , children stolen etc etc ) as " i was raised in shame " . this is a negative description - he was made to feel bad about himself . in alice springs aboriginal english , being brought up with shame would be the ' right way ' to be brought up . having ' no shame ' indicates the wrong behaviour in the circumstances , that 's when you should feel bad about yourself ! this 's hift ' in meaning is due to the substrate languages having a word that people translate into 's hame ' in english , when that 's not exactly what is meant , eg ' apure ' , eastern arrernte , and ' kurnta ' in warlpiri . this has been discussed by jean harkins in the australian journal of linguistics , and in her book " into another world " . so . . . what does it mean to be shameless ? sue morrish , teacher linguist , institute for aboriginal development , alice springs northern territory , australia 0870 .

<subject> sum : function words </subject> i . the question and its motivation three weeks ago or so , i asked linguist readers to help me find examples of function words with unusually specific meanings . this was meant to elicit examples that i could mention in a paper called " the formal semantics of grammaticalization " , where i discuss what happens to the meaning of a content morpheme that develops into a function morpheme . i argue there , developing work by other semanticists / logicians , that ( 1 ) function morphemes do have meanings ( contrary to a widespread assumption ) . just consider that the meanings of quantifiers , tense , aspect , modals , etc . are the bread and butter of us working semanticists . ( 2 ) there is a class of " logical " meanings that have certain formal properties ( permutation-invariance , high types ) . ( 3 ) unfortunately , there is no perfect correlation between logical meanings and functional morphemes . there are lexical / content morphemes with ( almost ) logical meanings ( adjectives " same " , " mere " , " alleged " , verbs " deny " , " believe " , nouns " majority " , etc . ) . and there might be functional morphemes with non-logical meanings ( hence the linguist query ) . ( 4 ) thus there is not much that we can say about what happens to the meaning of a morpheme that is becoming grammaticalized . although i make some presumably doomed efforts . the finished paper ( which is based on a talk i gave at the nels 25 workshop on language change ) will appear in the nels 25 proceedings ( to be available from the glsa at umass amherst , glsa @ linguist . umass . edu ) . the paper is downloadable by anonymous ftp from the following url : ftp : / / broca . mit . edu / pub / fintel / gramma . ps i would welcome any comments . ii . some of the responses : mark robert hale ( hale1 @ alcor . concordia . ca ) wrote : ) the reference [ to the pejorative pronouns " you shit " ] ) is samuel elbert 's grammar of ) rennellese / bellona , " echo of a culture : a grammar ) of rennell and bellona " , uhawaii press 1988 ) [ oceanic linguistics special publication no . 22 ] . ) ) a few interesting cases of ) grammaticalization of a somewhat relevant ) type do exist . in micronesian languages ) there are a set of verbal affixes for ) directionality ( up , down , towards speaker , ) towards hearer , towards some third ) party [ the usual deixis system ] ) which ) also include " toward the open ocean " ) and " toward the lagoon " ; whereas ( of course ) ) if you want to say " toward john 's house " ) ( or some other nonce collocation ) ) you need to use a pp . ) ) similar , but probably not similar enough , ) is the bizarre use of the cardinal directionals ) in icelandic documented in a classic paper ) by einar haugen ( i can dig up the reference ) if you really want it ) . it seems like , being ) predominantly coastal inhabitants , and having ) a rather uneven fjorded coastline , to go ) to a city which was north of you actually ) involved heading out in a southerly ) direction ( all that time ) .

<subject> sum : more discussion of human and non-human language </subject> content - length : 18462 there 's been a fair amount of discussion about language among non-humans , both publicly on linguist and privately with me , since my previous summa - ry in linguist 6-28 . i have already posted to linguist a bibliographical list , broadcast in linguist 6-195 ; here follows a summary of some of the main points that have come up in discussion . first of all , i 'd like to thank the following people who posted messages to me personally : dan alford , a . k . a . moonhawk ( dalford @ s1 . csuhayward . edu ) celso alvarez - caccamo ( lxalvarz @ udc . es ) rachel lagunoff ( ihw1009 @ mvs . oac . ucla . edu ) dorothy hinshaw patent ( doropatent @ aol . com ) john e . limber ( jel @ christa . unh . edu ) alex schwartz ( alex _ schwartz @ sagepub . com ) andrew spencer ( spena @ essex . ac . uk ) mike tomasello ( tomas @ fs1 . psy . emory . edu ) bill turkel ( bill @ hivnet . ubc . ca ) george williams ( gww @ navisoft . com ) in addition to these individuals , the following people have posted items on the subject of language among nonhumans to linguist since 6-28 . i ' m going to focus less on these in the following summary , on the assumption that most of you have already read what they had to say . lloyd anderson ( ecoling @ applelink . apple . com ) sherri l . condon ( slc6859 @ usl . edu ) jane a . edwards ( edwards @ cogsci . berkeley . edu ) larry gorbet ( lgorbet @ mail . unm . edu ) jacques guy ( j . guy @ trl . oz . au ) gilbert harman ( ghh @ princeton . edu ) marion kee ( marion . kee @ a . nl . cs . cmu . edu ) bob krovetz ( krovetz @ cs . umass . edu ) roger lass ( roger @ beattie . uct . ac . za ) david pesetsky ( pesetsk @ mit . edu ) benji wald ( ibeneawj @ mvs . oac . ucla . edu ) sherman wilcox ( wilcox @ alcor . unm . edu ) one major issue that came up in discussion was the methodological and ethical justification of evaluating the linguistic ability of non-humans by confronting them with the task of mastering a language belonging to homo sapiens , instead of by investigating the means by which they inter - act amongst themselves . in linguist , benji wald pointed out that chomsky himself , in a paper pub - lished in the sebeok / sebeok vol . mentioned in my bibliography in linguist 6-195 , carefully drew the distinction between ' human language ' , the cog - nitive system built into the * human * brain that enables us to master the various human languages that are the raw data of our studies , and ' lan - guage ' ( which i shall in this posting capitalize - - not to be confused with lsa 's journal ) , the set of all possible similar systems , in whatever species ( or machine ) they may manifest themselves . this phase of the dis - cussion began with the question of the relation between an ability to re - cognize one 's image in a mirror and an ability to handle pronouns of vari - ous sorts , including reflexives . ( briefly , dogs and cats are able to re - cognize their reflections as members of their own species but consistently treat them as ' others ' , behaving toward them as they would to strangers of their own species ; roger lass has suggested that the ability to re - cognize the reflection as 's elf ' may not be evolutionarily advantageous to such predatory animals . the anthropoid apes , however , manage after a few minutes to realize that the reflection is 's elf ' , at which point they switch from the 's ocial ' behaviours they would normally use to make the acquaintance of strangers of their own species to using the mirror as a tool for self-inspection . but there has been no evidence presented , to my knowledge or that of anyone else on the list , that chimps , gorillas , etc . have any ability to handle anaphoric reference the way human apes do . sherri condon referred us to the work of her colleague at the univer - sity of southwestern louisiana , daniel j . povinelli , on this subject . ) but ultimately this discussion came back to a fundamental issue raised in my previous summary : even were it possible , through ingenious programme design and / or arduous effort , to teach a real human language to a chimp or a gorilla , the mere fact that the system in question would have to be ' force-fed ' , as it were , is evidence in itself that there is a serious difference between the cognitive systems of the two species ( human and non-human ) in question , since humans pick the stuff up with almost no training whatsoever . since much of our research programme is dedicated , more or less directly , to investigating the ability of humans to learn individual human languages ' naturally ' ( i . e . , with a minimum of effort ) - - at least in childhood - - this unredoubted fact places the linguistic abilities of non-humans at a significant distance from our discipline 's focus area . whether the field of linguistics ought to broaden its focus area to include non-human quasi-linguistic semiotic / communicative systems is another question , of course , that was raised in private discussion with me . speaking for myself , i am very sympathetic to the notion of embedding ( to use a very professional word ) linguistics as we now under - stand it within a broader programme of research into language , including the semiotic / communicative systems of non-human animals . supposing that such animals could accomplish the task of mastering a hu - man language ( which has so far not happened ) , this would certainly prove that the difference in species is not relevant to the nature of the lan - guage in question , much less language in general . but failure to accom - plish the task is not as probative , since it can be interpreted in either of at least two ways : ( 1 ) the animals in question are no more than ' protolinguistic ' ( to use bickerton 's term ) , unable to master a system of the complexity of human language - - a quantitative evaluation . ( 2 ) the animals in question are already in possession of an equivalent system of comparable complexity but of incompatible organization ( which ipso facto interferes catastrophically with the proposed task ) - - a qua - litative evaluation . which of these alternatives is correct will require a completely diffe - rent set of experiments , carefully studying the communicative behaviours natural to these animals as we linguists study the communicative beha - viours natural to humans . one of my correspondents said , ' why is all this effort devoted towards teaching apes a modified version of english ? a complex and highly social species such as this has an extremely sophisticated natural communication system of its own , yet we know very little about this . . . surely , before embarking on experimental meddling of dubious methodological validity , it would be more prudent to construct a research program aimed at mapping out the cognitive abilities of the various species and more particularly , their home-grown communication systems . presumably , it 's only against the background of how apes communicate with each other in the wild that we will really be able to interpret the kinds of artificial experiments pio - neered by the gardners and others . . . when you provide the reference list it would be extremely interesting ( though a lot of hard work ) to compare the amount of research effort expended on teaching apes 2 - year old english , compared to the number of studies devoted to ethological study of ape communication . ' a further , related issue was the epistemological question of how to reco - gnize behaviour in another species that is equivalent to language in hu - mans . i remarked myself at one point , ' human language is not purely a communication system , and its structure is not based solely on its commu - nicative function . i use language for a variety of functions . . . it does not strike me as logically self-evident that all of these functions should be served by the same system . i can imagine a species that en - gaged in all of these behaviours but used a radically different system for each . would we be able to recognize all these different systems ? and would all of them properly fall into the field of inquiry we call ' lin - guistics ' ? larry gorbet , in his linguist posting , touched very well on a further as - pect of this problem , addressing in particular one of the criticisms that has been made of the results achieved by the gardners et al . ' any formal element whose meaning includes displacement ( or more generally , * any * fairly abstract meaning ) will be intrinsically difficult to recognize as such , simply because the " search space " ( for the observable behavior that points to meaning ) is so large . the result is an * intrinsic * sample bias in semantic analysis : concrete meanings are more likely to be * disco - vered * than are more abstract ones , relative to their actual frequency of occurrence . in addition to abstract meanings in the more obvious sense , meanings which concern internal states ( e . g . " emotions " ) can be difficult to discern if one does n't experience those states or similar ones . ' a couple of references to the science fiction literature are relevant here , science fiction being often very useful for such ' thought-experi - ments ' in the einsteinian sense . h . beam piper , who while definitely not pc was brilliant , wrote a story called ' naudsonce ' ( pp . 57-112 in the col - lection federation , published 1981 by ace . piper suicided in 1964 , and i have no idea whether ' naudsonce ' was published anywhere during his life - time ) , in which an exploration party from earth discovers an extrasolar planet inhabited by an obviously sapient species which the explorers la - bel ' svants ' . these people are living at roughly a neolithic cultural / technological level , and there 's no question that they communicate by means of deliberately modulated sound waves transmitted through the air , so the humans immediately jump to the conclusion that they have something akin to what we call ' language ' , and the professional linguist they ' ve brought along for just such eventualities gets to work trying to analyse the svants ' ' language ' and establish inter-species communication . no go . turns out that although both svants and humans communicate by means of deliberately modulated , etc . , the resemblance ends there . our auditory systems ( by which i mean both the auditory centers of our brains and the neurosensory systems in our ears that serve as their input ) are designed to convert auditory impulses into a distinct sensory experience that we call ' hearing ' . the svants ' neurosensory systems are designed to convert such impulses into something more closely approximating the sensory expe - rience that tells us about our internal states ( e . g . , feelings of hunger , thirst , satiation , heartburn , etc . ) . thus , when a human reports a feel - ing of pain or pleasure , another human apprehends the message intellectu - ally ; when a svant reports such a feeling , an equivalent feeling is di - rectly induced in the body of another svant . in order to have any hope of inter-species communication , the human explorers have to rely on two peculiar individuals : a young male svant who is as a result of a birth defect 'd eaf ' , but is otherwise quite intelligent and shows promise of being able to master an ideographic writing system , and his mother , who is ' normal ' but sticks with her son out of maternal affection , and can interpret for him to the rest of the svant community . my point in giving this rather lengthy summary is that recognition of the fundamental diffe - rence between the human and svant communicative systems constitutes a ma - jor , and very challenging , cognitive leap for the human explorers ; can we be confident that a similar cognitive leap would not be necessary for us in evaluating the cognitive behaviours of non-human apes , cetaceans , etc . ? ( piper , speaking through some of his characters , expresses scepticism that a species whose principal communication system so thoroughly bypas - ses the ' higher / rational ' cognitive centers can develop very far in the way of civilization . i personally do n't share his scepticism . several of us during discussion have considered that cetaceans use sound both as their principal means of exploring the world around them , via sonar , and apparently to communicate . this suggests that a cetacean mode of commu - nication might involve ' projecting ' a sonar ' image ' of what one is talk - ing about into the listener 's brain . such projection may involve vocali - zation skill levels outside the abilities of cetaceans ; but assuming they could do it , i do n't think such 'd irect ' communicative methods preclude a high level of civilization . i ' m not sure they ' re all that different from the ability of the chinese , or of fluent signers , to communicate highly abstract concepts by means of what is essentially visual imagery . ) those of you who have read suzette hayden elgin 's intriguing though dif - fuse novel native tongue may remember that in that novel , humans , having over the course of several decades established contact with a variety of alien species and managed to negotiate profitable trade deals with seve - ral of them in spite of the obvious language barriers ( the only reason the generally despised profession of ' linguist ' is allowed to survive in this crypto-fascist state ) , encounters a species that is obviously sapi - ent and obviously endowed with something in the way of a language ( if i remember correctly , it 's not made clear exactly how this is recognized ) , but that ' language ' is so radically different from human language in its structural organization that no human seems to be able to get the hang of it ( several people die trying ) . in both cases , we are left with the big question : what , exactly , consti - tutes language , or a ' language ' ? and how do we recognize one if it exists ? on the subject of the cognitive organization of the brains of non-human primates , steven pinker , on p . 350 of his recent book the language ins - tinct : how the mind creates language , discusses their equivalents of broca 's and wernicke 's areas : ' the neuroanatomists al galaburda and terrence deacon have discovered areas in monkey brains that correspond in location , input-output cabling , and cellular composition to the human language areas . for example , there are homologues to wernicke 's and broca 's areas and a band of fibers connecting the two , just as in humans . the regions are not involved in producing the monkeys ' calls , nor are they involved in producing their gestures . the monkey seems to use the regions corresponding to wernicke 's area and its neighbors to recognize sound sequences and to discriminate the calls of other monkeys from its own calls . the broca 's homologues are involved in control over the mus - cles of the face , mouth , tongue , and larynx , and various subregions of these homologues receive inputs from the parts of the brain dedicated to hearing , the sense of touch in the mouth , tongue , and larynx , and areas in which streams of information from all the senses converge . ' for those of you who are interested , the relevant references are : deacon , t . w . 1988 .

' role of architectonics and con - nections in the study of primate brain evolution ' in e . armstrong & d . falk , eds . , primate brain evolution . new york : plenum . beyond this , there is the fact that the integration of even complex so - cial systems is not enough to account for the complexity of human lan - guage . a large number of human social situations seem to be manageable by just a few dozen different utterances ; yet we have a natural linguis - tic ability vastly in excess of that . i suspect that our ancestors may have developed that ability through some nonce mutation , and then over the subsequent millenia have gradually developed uses for it . ( for some at least tangentially relevant thoughts on this subject , see theodore zeldin 's recently published intimate history of humanity , harper - collins . ) before closing this posting , i will quote the following from dorothy hinshaw patent 's message to me , and reiterate my plea in linguist 6-28 for more user-friendliness in our interactions with people who are rea - sonably intelligent , may be well-educated , may even be fellow scientists , but just are n't linguists . ' i was very frustrated by the critics of the ape language work ; they seemed to be looking for reasons to say the work did n't have meaning , and i think your piece summarized many of the frustrations of people like me very well . would that everyone were able to think so clearly ! what i 'd like to see is a linguistic analysis - - using minimal linguistic jargon , so zoologists and psychologists could understand it , too - - of the work done with apes , dolphins , sea lions , and parrots , comparing the " accom - plishments " of the different species to one another and to human chil - dren . i 'd like the person doing it to make the assumption , as you have , that the work does have meaning , and go from there , rather than trying to find picky reasons for discounting it because of human hubris . ' let us instead adopt the attitude expressed by sherri condon : ' i think we have much to learn about cognition and communication in all species , and we are fortunate that careful researchers are on the job . ' of course , as is always true not * all * researchers ' on the job ' are ' careful ' , by which i understand ' responsible , not wedded to their hypotheses to such an ex - tent that they are unable to wrestle appropriately with contrary evidence or alternative approaches ' , but the responsible ones definitely deserve encouragement ! best , steven - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - dr . steven schaufele 712 west washington urbana , il 61801 217-344 - 8240 fcosws @ prairienet . org * * * * o syntagmata linguarum liberemini humanarum ! * * * * * * nihil vestris privari nisi obicibus potestis ! * * *
<subject> obligatory affixes : summary </subject> several weeks ago i asked how the traditional notion of obligatory affixes was recast in the theory of realizational morphology . the responce was not exactly overwhelming , but i wish to thank greg stump ( eng101 @ ukcc . uky . edu ) , don ringe ( dringe @ unagi . cis . upenn . edu ) , r . beard ( rbeard @ coral . bucknell . edu ) , and andrew carstairs - mccarthy ( a . c-mcc @ ling . canterbury . ac . nz ) for helpful responses . a few responses ( slightly edited ) : greg stump : in paradigm function theory , a language 's inventory of morphosyntactic features is assumed to determine - - for any major syntactic category x - - a paradigm schema : a set of cells each of which is associated with a complete and fully specified set of morphosyntactic feature specifications appropriate to category x . in latin , for example , the features of case ( i . e . nominative , genitive , dative , accusative , ablative ) , number ( singular , plural ) , and gender ( masculine , feminine , neuter ) determine a paradigm schema for adjectives which consists of thirty cells , one for each of the case / number / gender combinations for which adjectives may be inflected . an adjective 's paradigm is then viewed as the inventory of inflected forms assigned to these cells . for any given cell c in the adjectival paradigm schema , there is a corresponding paradigm function which applies to an adjectival lexeme l to yield the inflected form of l assigned to c . paradigm functions are defined in terms of more specific morphological rules , including rules of exponence and rules of referral ; two or more of these may come into competition in the evaluation of a given paradigm function , in which case the narrower rule overrides the more general . how , then , is the notion of obligatory affixes recast in this theory ? notice first that the architecture of the theory guarantees that every inflected word w of category x will be associated with a complete and fully specified set of morphosyntactic feature specifications appropriate to x , and that it is this set of specifications that drives the inflection of w . in other words , it is the morphology , not ( pace anderson ) the syntax , that ` ensures that any given word has all the features required by the affixes in question ' . ( naturally , i assume that a lexeme 's invariant feature specifications - - e . g . a noun 's gender - - are simply supplied by its lexical entry . ) second , if a particular affix position must be filled , then that position can be assumed to be associated with a set of rules of affixal exponence the least narrow of which functions as the default for that position . [ i have some questions about how that works where the choice of one affix seems to require the presence of morphosyntactic features which are otherwise absent , but it may be that all such examples could be reanalyzed . it would be unfair of me to say more until i ' ve had a chance to correspond with greg . - - mm ] [ some references : ] ` a paradigm-based theory of morphosemantic mismatches ' , _ language _ 67 ( 1991 ) , 675-725 . ` on the theoretical status of position class restrictions on inflectional affixes ' , in _ yearbook of morphology 1991 _ , ed . by geert booij and jaap van marle , 211-241 .

<subject> workshop announcement articulatory databases </subject> workshop on articulatory databases munich thursday 25th and friday 26th may , 1995 we are currently starting the preparations for a two-day workshop on articulatory databases . this will be the third in the series of workshops organized by the accor working group ( a consortium of phonetic institutes financed by the european community 's esprit programme ) and and follows the electromagnetic articulography meeting in munich ( april , 1992 ) , and the tongue modelling meeting in barcelona ( december 1993 ) . a few words on the aims of a meeting devoted to such an apparently dry topic : the basic premise is that the free availability of articulatory data could provide benefits in several partly overlapping areas : in basic research it could allow investigators to test hypotheses formulated in articulatory terms on a much wider range of data than the individual worker would normally be able to acquire or access unaided . it could promote the development and testing of algorithms for deriving articulatory representations from acoustic data - relevant both for basic understanding of speech production as well as in potential applications such as speech displays for training the speech impaired . it could promote the development and testing of algorithms for speech synthesis / recognition using an articulatory level of representation . the aim of the workshop would be to generate an exchange of ideas among people active in these areas in order to identify , for example ( further suggestions welcome ) : 1 ) what articulatory data is in existence that it would be beneficial to make more freely available ( archival / retrospective approach ) ? 2 ) what standards should freely available data meet ? - specification of recording conditions - anatomical frames of reference - levels of accuracy / reliability - linguistic specification of the speech samples - preferred data structures for distribution . - any other issues relevant to the data being used without risk of misinterpretation by people not actually involved in the the details of acquisition articulatory data can come in many guises depending on the speech subsystem tapped into and the transduction technique used . thus , it is possible to monitor position ( 1 , 2 or 3 dimensions ) , force , emg , airpressure / flow with techniques that may be static or dynamic , may involve imaging or point-tracking etc . etc . we think that people directly involved in acquisition can also benefit from considering how techniques can be standardized to promote maximum comparability of recordings made at different sites and with different hardware . 3 ) in analogy to acoustic databases ( where unlabelled data is of only the most limited use ) , what segmentation and labelling information ( and tools for the exploitation thereof ) could / should be made available with the raw data to facilitate flexible access for different purposes ? 4 ) for future recordings , what categories of data and corpora would be potentially of most widespread use ? if you are interested in participating please contact phil hoole ( preferably by email ) at the address below as soon as possible . further information on registration and format for presentations will be distributed early in 1995 . please also draw this letter to the attention of any colleagues you think might be interested . phil hoole and hans tillmann institut fuer phonetik munich university schellingstr . 3 d - 80799 munich germany fax : + 49 89 2800362 email : hoole @ sun1 . phonetik . uni-muenchen . de

<subject> whatever happened to 'd ? </subject> dear subscribers , recently i came across an example of better used without had in the following construction : she better stop . as it was an american publication , i assumed that the use of had in such expressions had completely disappeared , in written as well as spoken us english . i would not have been surprised to find that it had disappeared from spoken usage , since there are obvious phonological reasons , but the loss of it in writing indicated to me that the use of better alone was quite standardised . this poses a question for me , and i was wondering if anyone out there has a suggestion . if it is now standardised , and there is no longer a had , why does n't the former bare infinitive stop now become finite and take 3ps inflection ( ? she better stops ) ? is this because it now has assumed a subjunctive-like quality ? can it then be associated with the expression : it is better that she stop ? if so , can another adjective be substituted for better here , e . g . it is good that she stop ) ? ? she good stop ? how has this been reanalysed , and what are the implications ? ( susan dopke informs me that some grammarians have interpreted better in these contexts as an auxiliary , and if that is the case , can we use sub-aux inversion to make it a question ? ( ? better she stop ? ) is this now acceptable too ? please send your suggestions if this bothers you . debbie ziegeler
<subject> seminar : the conservation of endangered languages </subject> the centre for theories of language and learning university of bristol department of philosophy announces a seminar on the conservation of endangered languages friday april 21st 1995 at 9 woodland rd , bristol bs8 1tb , england according to reliable estimates , half of the world 's six thousand languages will become extinct in the next century . furthermore , two thousand of the remaining three thousand languages will be threatened during the century after next . in the uk these startling facts have recently received media attention , stimulated partly by the publication this year of the atlas of the world 's languages , edited by christopher moseley and r . e . asher ( routledge ) . the rapid decline is largely due to a mixture of economic and political pressures affecting communities that speak minority languages , pressures which remove the new generation 's motivation for communicating in their traditional language . the problem of language-extinction raises fundamental questions . what is the value of these threatened languages to science and to humankind in general ? what principles might justify us in striving to keep small languages alive ? what reasons are there for preserving them in archive form ? the seminar is aimed primarily at academics from such disciplines as philosophy , ethics , anthropology , linguistics , sociolinguistics , cultural history , ecology and population biology , but is open to all interested persons . seminar programme registration desk opens 9 . 30a . m . 10-11 am mapping the future of the world 's languages mr . christopher moseley , co - editor of atlas of the world 's languages 1994 11-12 should linguistic diversity be preserved ? dr . mark pagel , dept of zoology , oxford university 12 - 1 who wants to learn a native language in latin america ? prof . marcelo dascal , inst . of advanced studies , hebrew university of jerusalem 1 - 2 lunch 2 - 3 thinking twice : issues in welsh as a second language in children under 5 ms . sian wyn siencyn , language consultant , author of the sound of europe 3 - 4 orchestrating language revival mr . allan wynne jones , european bureau for lesser used languages 4 - 6 round table and discussion with contributions from the floor * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * seminar registration form i should like to register for the one day seminar at bristol university and enclose my cheque for the amount stated below . signature : name ( capitals ) : address and telephone : e-mail : accomodation wanted ? a limited amount of single bed and breakfast accomodation can be provided near to the seminar venue , at a cost of 22 uk pounds per night ( standard room ) or 36 uk pounds ( en suite room ) . b&b night of thursday 20th april : _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ b&b night of friday 21st april : _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ total ( accomodation ) : _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ registration fee : 5 uk pounds total : _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ please send this form and cheque payable to ' the university of bristol ' to : ctll , graduate studies centre , 7 woodland road , bristol bs8 1tb uk . for further information , contact the seminar organisers dan brickley and andrew woodfield ( email : centre-tll @ bristol . ac . uk ) a background article on the topic is also available by email or by accessing the ctll world wide web pages using the following internet url : http : / / www . bris . ac . uk / depts / philosophy / ctll / index . html

<subject> release of agfl home page </subject> this message announces the release of the world wide web home page of agfl ( affix grammars over a finite lattice ) . 1 . agfl the agfl formalism , developed at the university of nijmegen , the netherlands , is a formalism in which context free grammars can be described compactly . agfls are two level grammars : a first , context free level is augmented with features for expressing agreement between parts of speech . features are treated as types , and their values may range over the subsets of a given finite set , which explains the acronym affix grammars over a finite lattice . agfl grammars are transformed into a parser by the parser generator opt . the generated parser is a recursive backup parser which computes the values of the affixes on the fly . in this way , fast and efficient parsers can be generated . the formalism is quite simple and limited , and therefore easy to read and write . agfl comes with a grammar workbench gwb , supporting the development of grammars and the checking of their consistency . the agfl formalism does not require any special hardware . the parser generator opt runs on regular sparc - systems and ms-dos machines ( 386 or higher ) and is relatively small . for instance , the ms-dos version requires less than 1 mb harddisk space . 2 . agfl on the web agfl has now been made available to the ( computational ) linguistic community . we think it can be used by ( computational ) linguists who are in need of a simple grammar formalism with a fast parser generator , suitable for experimental purposes . therefore , we have made agfl available via ftp and , recently , via www . the agfl home page contains information about the agfl formalism like the agfl manual , documentation and papers , sample grammars and the latest developments . there is also the possibility to download the software and to register yourself as an agfl user . you are invited to take a look at the home page and to read the information or to download the software . please feel free to make use of agfl and its home page ; we look forward to hear about your experiences . we are currently planning an agfl workshop in june . the latest news about this workshop can also be found on the agfl home page . the url of the agfl home page is : http : / / www . cs . kun . nl / agfl / the address of the ftp - site is : ftp : / / hades . cs . kun . nl / pub / agfl / the organisation of the www page should be self-explanatory . the structure of the ftp - site is as follows : - readme - doc : this directory contains a number of relevant papers - pc386 : this directory contains software for ms-dos machines and an installation guide . - sun4 : this directory contains software for sparc - stations and an installation guide . any questions or remarks with respect to agfl or the agfl home page can be sent to : www-agfl @ cs . kun . nl . on behalf of the agfl team , erik oltmans department of computer science university of nijmegen the netherlands

<subject> item for linguist </subject> in memoriam simon c . dik ( 1940-1995 ) it is with great sadness that we inform you of the death , on march 1 , 1995 , of simon c . dik , one of the world 's leading theoreticians in functional linguistics . simon had occupied the chair of general linguistics at the university of amsterdam for 25 years when in 1994 his illness , which had manifested itself two years earlier , forced him to resign . during these 25 years he developed the theory of functional grammar , the foundations for which had been laid in his 1968 dissertation on coordination . as far as his illness allowed him , simon continued working on the further development of this theory until his death . the results of this work , the two-volume ' the theory of functional grammar ' , will be published posthumously . during his career simon has been a constant source of inspiration and encouragement , both as a teacher and as a scholar , for his colleagues and students . the significance of his work for the field of linguistics and the effectivity of the enormous energy which he put into promoting linguistic research deserve our recognition and gratitude . we , members of the community of linguists working within the framework of functional grammar , especially feel the loss of our personal contacts with him . we gratefully acknowledge his unending and invaluable involvement in the progress of linguistic research until the very end . simon leaves behind his wife willy , his daughters iris and hester , and his son remco . machtelt bolkestein ( ot @ alf . let . uva . nl ) casper de groot ( casperdg @ alf . let . uva . nl ) kees hengeveld ( khengeveld @ alf . let . uva . nl )

<subject> j . r . firth 's ' context of situation ' </subject> thanks to the following people who kindly responded to my inquiry into work which attempts to apply j . r . firth 's notion of ' context of situation ' to studies of discourse : tom craven gudula stegmann graham mcgregor joe foley koenraad kuiper richard ogden in summary , it appears that although firth 's notion is familiar to many sociolinguists , discourse and conversation analysts - as evidenced in references typically appearing in overviews on the notion of ' context ' - surprisingly little work has been , or is being , actually undertaken on the topic . a reference where this phenomenon is exemplified is the introductory chapter in duranti , a . & goodwin , c . ( 1992 ) ( eds . ) rethinking context . cup . koenraad kuiper reports that he has a forthcoming paper which offers a reappraisal of the origins of the term ' context of situation ' ; graham mcgregor has conducted an ( unpublished ) study of person-reference which incorporates firth 's notion into his analytical approach . i shall be happy to inform readers of the list of my future uncoverings of applied firthian linguistics . alan firth aalborg university , denmark

<subject> re : 6 . 199 ipa </subject> why must this kind of stuff be decided by a vote ? since obviously ipa membership does not equal interest in the matter and never will , all that will be achieved if some of us join the ipa just to force this issue , is that it will be " packed " in some other way than the way it is now , but it will never be representative . why not let the invisible hand of the " market " of ideas operate freely instead ? as fewer and fewer people use ipa 's made-up symbols , either that organization will become completely irrelevant , or it will make up its own mind to respond to the " market forces " , or perhaps some other group will step in and by proposing a system that is manifestly better than anyone else 's , achieve standardization that way . i really think that if a few of the top names in phonetics got together with the editors of a few journals , they could probably come up with something . it could also simply come from anywhere else : if someone were to publish a truly superior system and people started using it . finally , in reality , it seems that certain trends are occurring anyway and that in particular the resistance to the hachek and the use of the corresponding ipa symbols are on the wane . if we can put up with the inconsistencies of american vs . canadian vs . british spelling , we can probably do just as well here . and if we are gonna worry about something , i would worry more about those cases where te same symbols have different commonly used meanings like ' j ' and ' y ' . alexis mr

<subject> re : 6 . 108 sum : words that are their own opposites ( part 2 ) </subject> after attending a meeting , i heard someone say , " the acceptance of this plan will depend on its oversight . " i immediately thought of the meaning : " an unintentional omission or mistake " ( ahd ) . what was intended , however , was another meaning : " watchful care or management ; supervision " ( ahd ) . the latter meaning , i think , is becoming the more common one , but it still startles me . in the same way , synonyms may become antonyms in compounds . " to oversee " is quite different from " to overlook . " i would also point out that nonstandard " borrow " for " lend " is still heard . it may have about the same distribution as " learn " to mean " teach . " up to at least the sixties , english textbooks for high schools carried stern admonitions for both . so these uses must have been quite common . finally , there is the famous " bad " of black english , which signifies its opposite . antithetical meanings may be common in slang for their shock value . " man , she 's one tough babe , " could indicate two quite contrasting , if not opposite meanings .
<subject> re : 6 . 293 words that are their own opposites </subject> sue morrish 's posting on shame in australian reminded me of a weird fact about the same word in south african english , according to some sa friends . this is that " shame ! " is used as an exclamation of joy by , for example , old ladies seeing a newborn baby or a fluffy animal . the supposed explanation is that " shame ! " as an exclamation of disapproval became an exclamation of sympathy for somebody who has been ill-treated ( so far , this parallels a shift that i ' m familiar with too ) . it then bleached out still further in sa to a mere " back channel utterance " , indicating that the listener was still paying ( sympathetic ) attention , and then became a positive expression of pleasure . can anybody confirm either the data or the explanation ? btw , wrt benji wald 's posting , i understood the origin of a ' lucus a non lucendo ' to be st isidore of seville 's _ origines sive etymologiae _ ( 7th c ) - according to father dinneen 's book on the history of linguistics i think . john t waterman in his little book perspectives on linguistics ( 1963 ) gives another example from the same source : bellum ( war ) from bellus ( beautiful ) , because war is far from beautiful ! regards , paul werth
<subject> human and non - human languages </subject> bearing on the question of primate language skills is the observation that they appear not to imitate the * manner * of doing something - - controverting the " monkey see , monkey do " saw . a clue as to why people have cultures and languages and primates do not came up in a national geographic series on primate research that i saw a few weeks ago . they had shown some chimps using sticks to poke through holes in a " beehive " and suck off honey , introducing the topic of tool use . in the next segment , the researcher had some candy on a table surrounded by some sort of cage with vertical bars . he had a primitive kind of rake with three wide-spaced tines resting on the table , the handle through the bars . the chimp had the same , on an adjacent section of the table . if the tines were down , they could n't get the candy because the wide-spaced tines could n't retain it . the researcher demonstrated flipping the rake over . with the back of the rake on the table top , it was easy to pull the candy to one 's hand . no matter how often he saw it , the chimp did n't get it . the inference from this and other experiments was that the primate perceives use of the tool to accomplish the end , but does not attend to the manner of using the tool . in the next segment , there is a similar setup with a small child . the child fails with the tines down . then the adult demonstrates flipping his rake over . the child immediately , on the next turn , does the same , even moving the rake through a curving path very much like that executed by the adult 's rake , to capture the object ( a block ) and pull it back to the edge . in support of this hypothesis , i believe there are no observations of cultural differences between one community of primates and another comparable to differences of human " body language " style and linguistic dialect - - differences in the manner of doing the " same " things , functionally inconsequential differences such that " we " do these things this way and " they " do the same things that way . bruce nevin bn @ lightstream . com

<subject> aaas </subject> what follows are the minutes of the meeting of section z - linguistics and the language science - - held during the atlanta aaas annual meeting . the section committee hopes that this will be of interest to all linguists and once again urges any linguist not yet a member of aaas to join and select section z as their priary affiliation . ( a membership form follows the minutes ) v . fromkin , section z , secretary = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = section z - - linguistics & the language sciences section meeting - february 17 , 1995 , 2 : 30 - 5 : 30 pm marriott marquis , atlanta , ga . minutes attendance : retiring chair barbara lust , chair , richie kayne , chair - elect stephen anderson , chair elect 1995 sarah thomason , secretary , vicki fromkin , members of steering committee : paul chapin , ilse lehiste , paul chapin , section z representative to aaas council , arnold zwicky , and 10-25 individuals ( 20 signed the attendance sheet ) . ( 1 ) the meeting was called to order and chaired by chair richie kayne . the attendees were asked to introduce themselves . ( 2 ) the minutes of the feb . 21 , 1993 section meeting were distributed and approved . ( 3 ) the results of the last election were reported : sarah ( sally ) thomason was elected chair - elect for 1995 , and david caplan was elected member at large 1995 - 1998 . the members of the steering committee for 1995 ( as of february 21 , 1995 ) therefore consist of : retiring chair richie kayne , chair stephen anderson , chair elect sarah thomason , secretary victoria a . fromkin , members - at - large : david caplan , paul chapin , ilse lehiste . arnold zwicky remains as the council delegate through 1996 . the chair expressed the appreciation of all members of section z to retiring chair barbara lust ( who will serve on the council in 1995 ) and david pesetsky . ( 4 ) four sessions were sponsored by section z at this meeting : bilingualism : when is the best age to learn a second language ? ; endangered languages ; linguistic science and language technology : machines and human language ; structures of language : batons for cognitive science and neuroscience . in addition , section z cosponsored a session organized by the psychology section : instincts to learn . kenneth hale presented one of the topical lectures - - the scientific cost of the global loss of linguistic diversity . ken hale s lecture and the session on endangered languages received a great deal of interest from the press . ( this issue made national press coverage by the time of the section meeting , ) the section extended its gratitude to the session organizers and speakers , and to ken hale for their efforts in bringing linguistics to the general scientific community at the aaas . ( 5 ) dr . susan speece , chair of the department of biological sciences at anderson university , anderson in , who has been appointed as education liaison from the education section to section z was introduced . she distributed copies of life science standards and curriculum development for k-12 and reported on the work of the science education reform committee of the national research council and asked for suggestions and input from our section regarding science education k-12 and also undergraduate science education . , a discussion followed in which it was announced that stephen crain is heading a committee of the linguistic society of american on linguistics in the curriculum which is also concerned with the teaching of linguistic science in the schools . it was suggested that crain be asked to contact dr . speece . individuals were urged to view the poster paper linguistics in the schools : developing an epistemology of science by maya honda and wayne o neil on display from 10 : 30 to 3 : 30 on saturday , february 18 , in the marriott south exhibit hall . this poster paper is directly related to the subject under discussion . ( 6 ) budget . vicki fromkin reported on the budget situation . up to this meeting , section z received $ 2500 / annum from the aaas office which was supposed to cover the travel expenses of the section officers for the annual meeting , refreshments , and any expenses of the ssponsored sessions ( organizers and speakers ) that could be provided . last year we offered no support to symposia speakers . thus , this year after subtracting the probable expenses of the officers , the section budget total came to approximately $ 2500 . symposia organizers sent their requests to vicki fromkin . after she determined the cheapest possible fares of the speakers , she divided the sum so that no speaker who had requested funds would suffer financially more than the others and recommended to the aaas staff that these sums be disbursed . this leaves the section with a zero balance . at the planning committee which she attended , vicki reported that the staff had decided to change the section budgets . the expenses of the officers would no longer be deducted from the section allocation but would be borne by the central office . however , the sections would now receive much lower allocations ; section z will only receive $ 1000 / annum . it is urgent that symposia organizers inform their invited speakers that there is little if any money for expenses and speakers should attempt to find money elsewhere . ( 7 ) 1996 aaas annual meeting , baltimore , maryland , 8-13 february 1996 . proposals for sessions are due april 1 , 1995 . a general discussion was held regarding sessions to be sponsored by section z . the section agreed that it would like to see the following session organized .

( 8 ) 1997 aaas annual meeting , seattle , washington . an opening discussion on possible sessions for the seattle meeting was held it was suggested that individuals should submit proposals to the nsf to fund sessions on reports of current research which would be of interest to the scientific community . such proposals should be submitted to paul chapin by no later than july 15 , 1995 in order to have a funding decision from nsf by december 1995 , in time to submit a session proposal to the aaas program committee . ( 9 ) membership . as of the time of the meeting , 169 members of aaas had selected section z as their primary affiliation , and according to mike spinella ( aaas staff , who attended the meeting briefly ) , 141 had designated section z as their secondary affiliation and 205 as their third . this total of 515 satisfies the aaas requirements for establishing section z as a permanent section of the aaas . in the words of mike spinella you re in ! . however , it is important that we continue to increase the members whose first affiliation is to our section . we would like to see that number grow to a minimum of 400 . in the discussion on methods to increase membership it was suggested that we ask the lsa if we can include a letter from the section chair and secretary in the regular mailings to linguistic department chairs asking if each department would subsidize the membership fee for one member ( probably the chair ) of the department . if the chair is already a member , another person should be designated , who could be elected by the faculty or determined in some other way . this would substantially increase our membership . sharon goldsmith from asha announced that she would be willing to place a notice in the asha newsletters and publications which go to 80 , 000 of their members . paul chapin agreed to draft a letter to send to asha for this purpose . it was also suggested that a membership form be included in the mailings . she also thanked section z for their support of the symposium on bilingualism which was organized by asha and introduced david kean , of the asha research and tehcnology committee . . barbara lust suggested that we contact all the international organizations such as lagb who supported the formation of the new section and ask them to publicize the section and urge their members to join . the question of the cost of joining aaas was discussed . there was confusion as to the cost of joining as a supporting member ( without receiving science ) particularly for foreign applicants . mike spinella assured us that supporting memberships cost $ 35 . 00 for us , and all non - us members . on the application form this $ 35 . fee is stated only for spouses of members , but we were assured that it is for anyone who joins as a supporting member . ( 10 ) endangered languages . michael strauss spoke on the importance of our establishing ties with non-linguists concerned with conservation and diversity , i . e . conservation biology , etc . david harmon of the george wright society of the world parks congress was introduced and told the group that until recently he did not realize the extent of the problem re maintaining linguistic diversity and the dangers facing endangered languages . he supported the suggestion that linguists concerned with this issue work together with other groups interested in cultural and biological diversity and endangered species . ( 11 ) at the 1994 meeting , it was agreed that it was important for linguists to submit research articles to science . this was reiterated . it was pointed out that one cannot complain about the contents of the journal and the heavy weighting toward biology if we do not submit articles . should they consistently be rejected we would then have grounds for complaint . ( 12 ) vicki fromkin announced that the international congress of linguists ( organized by the permanent international committee of linguistics , better known by its french initials cipl ) would be held in paris , in july of 1997 . ( 13 ) michael strauss , the director of annual meetings on the aaas staff and estrella m . triana , the senior program associate , aaas directorate for education & human resources programs were introduced . estrella triana announced that 1998 was the 150th anniversary of aaas and urged members to support the issuing of a aaas commemorative stamp . she also announced the fund raising drive for a new building , and reminded members that sections of the aaas were entitled to hold meetings in the aaas building in washington , dc . the meeting was adjourned submitted by v . fromkin , secretary section z = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = membership request form mail to : aaas - po box 2033 marion oh 43306-2133 or fax to ( 202 ) 842 1065 name _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ address _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ city _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ state _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ zip _ _ _ _ _ _ _ membership category : ( includes 51 issues of science ) * regular member $ 97 * postdoctoral $ 72 ( payment required with order , ) * student $ 50 ( payment & student id required ) supporting member $ 35 ( does not include science ) check enclosed _ _ _ bill me later _ _ _ ( regular members ) visa _ _ _ _ master card _ _ _ _ credit card number _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ exp date section z primary affiliation : _ _ _ _ ( check here ) * all include 51 issues of science .
<subject> sum . : history of capitalisation in english </subject> back in late january / early february i posted a query to linguist about sources on the history of capitalisation in english . several people responded asking me to post a summary to the list on any replies i might receive . my apologies for the delay , but i have been fighting three different winter " bugs " ( some viral , some bacterial ) since my original posting , and then had to rush to catch up on acadaemic commitments before the end of term ! anyway , here is the summary . . . . the most immediate " success " reply , so to speak , came from david denison at u . of manchester , u . k . : mrcepdd @ fsl . art . man . ac . uk . david suggested the following article : osselton , noel ( 1985 ) ' spelling - book rules and the capitalization of nouns in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries ' . in arn , mary - jo and hanneke wirtjes ( eds . ) . * * historical and editorial studies in medieval and modern english : for johan gerritsen . * * wolters - noordhoff , groningen , pp . 49-61 . to my delight , i found that " my " university library ( knight lib . at the u . of oregon ) had precisely this volume . the article ( chapter ) is only 6 pages long , but contains as well a list of spelling books and grammars , etc . to which osselton referred in the text . there is also a page of notes . this reference is the most useful i have yet seen , and i will be using it ( when i have the time ) as a foundation for finding more info . on this topic . a good place to start , i think . a reply from john e . koontz ( koontz @ bldr . nist . gov ) pointed me towards usenet lists which , i regret , i have not yet been able to try . john suggests comp . fonts , or hte repositories of past usenet postings ( he is not sure where they are ) , or the usenet faq collections . also , comp . text . larry rosenwald ( lrosenwald @ wellesley . edu ) suggested looking into the literature of printing history , as he reminded me that " in fact capitalization was often regularized by the printer . " henry rogers ( rogers @ epas . utoronto . ca ) wrote and remarked that " [ t ] he distinction between upper and lower case in the roman alphabet obviously developed in the writing of the middle ages . . . " i confess that my knowledge of the middle ages is not sufficient to know why this is " obvious " , and i have n't yet managed to contact henry to find out . do you have a moment to respond , please , henry ? eleanor olds batchelder ( eobgc @ cunyvm . cuny . edu ) suggested i might look at geoffrey nunberg 's writings , " esp . his history of punctuation " , but she noted that this is " just a hunch " , as she has not yet read the work . nor have i , yet ! a final response came from stavros macrakis ( macrakis @ osf . org ) with the following suggestions : " i note that there is a library of congress ( tn3270 locis . loc . gov ) heading capitalization , but most of the books there are prescriptive or educational . there is also a subheading capitalization under languages , but english language - - capitalization gives only workbooks . i found some books on german capitalization which may ( or may not ) be helpful . see below . harvard 's catalogue lists 15 books on english capitalization , all prescriptive . = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = materialien zur historischen entwicklung der gross - und kleinschreibungsregeln / wolfgang mentrup ( hg . ) . tuebingen : niemeyer , 1980 . 336 p . lc call # pf3147 . m34 subjects [ for mentrup ] : german language - - capitalization - - history . + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + moulin , claudine . der majuskelgebrauch in luthers deutschen briefen ( 1517-1546 ) . heidelberg : winter , 1990 . xxxiii , 462 pp . subjects : luther , martin german language - - capitalization german language - - orthography and spelling originally presented as author 's doctoral thesis , 1989 , in otto - friedrich - universitaet , bamberg . = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = that is all . i would like to thank everyone who replied , even if only to express an interest . it was heartening to know that other people find this a tantalizing question as well . to conclude , i would like to put forward some further questions that have occurred to me as a result of the responses i received . . . . 1 ) in connection to the point about the rise of the printing industry as an important influence in * * regularising * * the use of capitalisation , i still have questions about the way people capitalised before the printing press . for instance , in religious writings , such as the book of kells ( eire ) , we find capital letters , ornately decorated , at the start of portions of text / top of the page . why were capitals used ? i have n't seen copies of the work , but did adam bede do the same ? 2 ) building on ( 1 ) , i then ask , where / why did the idea of capitalisation arise in the first place ? in quite a number of other writing systems of the world , a method of marking " important " words with a larger , and slightly different version , of the " normal " sized letters is completely absent . thus , who / why / where did capitalisation come into being ? we take this so much for granted , i wonder if we can still re - / discover the reasoning behind this " distinctiveness " strategy . ( and as a final parting shot , so to speak , i would like to point out that in english writing we use a capital letter for the 1st . p . s . in all environments , but not for any other person ! why ? was this a printing influence too ( e . g . , to distinguish it from small " i " in roman numerals ? ) . ) from talking to a local professor , russian , for instance , ( if i remember correctly ) , does not have this distinction . how about other language writing systems , european or not ? and what effect does this english pattern have on us psychologically ? in the sense that " i " is more important than " you , them " etc . ? ) . once again , thank-you to all respondents . i look forward to discussion , if any , on my questions - - either post to list or to me directly . regards to all , anthea . * * " words do n't mean , people mean . . . .

<subject> 6 . 351 language policy </subject> frank ashen focussed on the divisive effects of promoting one of several indigenous languages to the position of official language and used the much quoted justification that speakers of not-chosen languages may feel disadvantaged . he did not mention the effect of the introduction of a foreign world language on the vernaculars . the introduction of foreign official language has , in africa , led to explicit negative attitudes amongst the speakers themselves towards their languages . the alternative to the selection of an indigenous language as official language seems to be to disadvantage the whole population . in most african countries the foreign official language generally has a very low penetration so that only the elite know it . knowledge of the official language then becomes a new factor that determines access to power and the well-paid jobs . at the same time the vernaculars are ignored or stigmatised . this means that no or very little funds are available for their development and teaching . this means , to come back to tove skutnabb - kangas ' comments , that the population cannot exercise their " right to learn their mother tongue , both orally and in writing , up to a high level . " the assumption that frank ashen quotes is based on a false departure point , namely that only a colonial language can save an african country from being torn up by its own internal divisions . i do n't recall any wars based on language differences prior to colonisation . africa solved its linguistic diversity by developing lingua francas . djit ? recently ( 1993 ) showed that the use of so-called international languages such as english and french have not solved the communication problems of the african masses but in many cases contributed towards the " pathology of linguistic bakwardness " . the fact that these languages ( such as wolof , swahili , hausa , lingala ) are actually spreading - without much official help - seems to indicate " a general willingness for cooperation and a cultural and linguistic tolerance that ignores the political boundaries inherited from colonization " djit ? ( 1993 : 162 ) . spencer ( 1985 : 395 ) claims that the introduction of european languages to africa retarded the spread of what he calls " african vehicular languages " . however , adegbija ( 1994 : 26-27 ) is sceptical of the ability of african lingua francas of being accepted outside their present geographical domains . he also warns against the imposition of these languages . it would seem that we need a three-language policy such as that of india : one language for communication with the outside world known by a relatively small section of the population ; one lingua franca for national and regional communication and the various vernaculars for local business and primary education . in many african countries this is the de facto situation and trilingualism is more common in africa than outside linguists seem to realise . this suggestion might avoid the subtractive language learning ( that characterises many african communities ) and that tove skutnabb - kangas finds " a violation of minorities ' linguistic rights " . the sources that i referred to : adegbija , e . 1994 language attitudes in africa : a sociolinguistic overview . clevedon : multilingual matters . djit ? , p . g . 1993 " language development in africa .

( 2 ) computational models and ( 3 ) symbol grounding . the target audience of this colloquium will include engineers and scientists in neural networks and artificial intelligence , developmental psychologists , cognitive scientists , philosophers of mind , biologists and all of those interested in the application of artificial intelligence to real world problems . programme : monday , may 15th , 1995 * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * introduction : 9 . 00 registration + sustenance 10 . 00 ` an introduction ' noel sharkey ( department of computer science , university of sheffield , england ) biology : 10 . 30 ` the neuronal mechanisms of language ' valentino braitenberg ( max plank institute for biological cybernetics , tuebingen , germany ) computational models : 11 . 00 ` natural language and exploration of an information space ' oliviero stock ( istituto per la ricerca scientifica e technologica , irst ) ( trento , italy ) 11 . 30 ` how visual salience influences natural language descriptions ' wolfgang maass ( cognitive science programme ) ( universitaet des saarlandes , saarbruecken , germany ) 12 . 00 discussion 12 . 30 lunch grounding symbols : 2 . 00 ` on grounding language with neural networks ' georg dorffner ( austrian institute for artificial intelligence , vienna , austria ) 2 . 30 ` some observations on symbol-grounding from a combined symbolic / connectionist viewpoint ' john barnden ( computing research laboratory , new mexico , usa ) & ( department of computer science , university of reading , england ) 3 . 00 sustenance break 3 . 30 ` grounding symbols in sensorimotor categories with neural networks ' stevan harnad ( department of psychology , university of southampton , england ) panel discussion and questions : 4 . 00 ` grounding representations ' chairs + invited speakers s / in s / in : 4 . 30 ` de brief / comments ' paul mc kevitt ( department of computer science , university of sheffield , england ) 5 . 00 o / iche mha / ith * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * publication : we intend to publish a book on this colloquium proceedings . addresses iee contact : sarah leong groups officer the institution of electrical engineers ( iee ) savoy place gb - wc2r obl , london england , uk , eu . e - mail : sleong @ iee . org . uk ( sarah leong ) e - mail : mbarrett @ iee . org . uk ( martin barrett ) e - mail : dpenrose @ iee . org . uk ( david penrose ) www : http : / / www . iee . org . uk ftp : ftp . iee . org . uk fax : + 44 ( 0 ) 171-497 - 3633 phone : + 44 ( 0 ) 171-240 - 1871 ( general ) phone : + 44 ( 0 ) 171-344 - 8423 ( direct ) location : the institution of electrical engineers ( iee ) savoy place gb - wc2r obl , london england , uk , eu . academic contact : paul mc kevitt department of computer science regent court 211 portobello street university of sheffield gb - s1 4dp , sheffield england , uk , eu . e - mail : p . mckevitt @ dcs . shef . ac . uk www : http : / / www . dcs . shef . ac . uk / www : http : / / www . shef . ac . uk / ftp : ftp . dcs . shef . ac . uk fax : + 44 ( 0 ) 114-278 - 0972 phone : + 44 ( 0 ) 114-282 - 5572 ( office ) 282-5596 ( lab . ) 282-5590 ( secretary ) registration : registration forms are available from sarah leong at the above address and should be sent to the following address : ( it is not possible to register by e - mail . ) colloquium bookings institution of electrical engineers ( iee ) po box 96 stevenage gb - sg1 2sd herts england , uk , eu . fax : + 44 ( 0 ) 143 874 2792 receipt enquiries : + 44 ( 0 ) 143 876 7243 registration enquiries : + 44 ( 0 ) 171 240 1871 x . 2206 pre-registration is advised although you can register on the day of the event . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ r e g i s t r a t i o n costs _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ( all figures include vat ) iee members 44 . 00 non-iee members 74 . 00 iee members ( retired , unemployed , students ) free non-iee members ( retired , unemployed , students ) 22 . 00 lunch ticket 4 . 70 members : members of the ieeie , the british computer society and the society for the study of artificial intelligence and simulation of behaviour and eurel member associations will be admitted at members ' rates .
<subject> latex on pc 's </subject> last month i posted a query about latex on pcs . here 's a summary of the responses i got and my own experience in making my choice ( gtex ) work ( if you plan to adopt gtex , especially for windows nt , be sure to read my comments - - it will save you time . . . ) first , i 'd like to thank the following persons for proving , yet again , the power of the virtual community : alderson @ netcom . com ( richard m . alderson iii ) mark robert hale ( hale1 @ alcor . concordia . ca ) michael covington ( mcovingt @ ai . uga . edu ) stewart nichols ( nichols @ ccwf . cc . utexas . edu ) knappen @ vkpmzd . kph . uni - mainz . de ( j " org knappen ) sl70 @ musuko . spc . uchicago . edu ( stuart luppescu ) achim @ chianti . philosophie . uni-stuttgart . de ( achim stein ) terdoest @ cs . utwente . nl ( hugo ter doest ) wilhelm weisweber ( ww @ cs . tu-berlin . de ) alex schoenmakers ( alex . schoenmakers @ ccl . kuleuven . ac . be ) peter - arno coppen ( u250005 @ vm . uci . kun . nl ) koontz @ alpha . bldr . nist . gov ( john e . koontz ) syang @ uvvm . uvic . ca ( suying yang ) robert dale ( rdale @ microsoft . com ) alfredo arnaiz ( arnaiz @ scf . usc . edu ) c . l . thiersch @ kub . nl ( craig thiersch ) alice drewery ( alice @ cogsci . edinburgh . ac . uk ) all the messages were extremly helpful . they provided fairly detailed information and many offered further help if i needed it . thanks ! i have divided the information into the following categories : 1 . general tex info 2 . the unix option 3 . the commercial option 4 . the mac option 5 . emtex 6 . gtex ( including my own experience in installing and using it ) hope it is useful for others as well . ami kronfeld natural language inc . 1 ) general tex info - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - " you might want to check out the usenet group comp . tex . tex , and its faq . also , the book mking tex work , by norman walsh , from o'reilly associates . " " you can also check out the tex archives on the us ctan site : ftp . shsu . edu . " " the most comprehensive distribution is called 4alltex , it 's available at the standard ctan - archive sites ( like ftp . shsu . edu ) and on the cd - rom " snapshot " of same from prime time ( prime time texcetera ) . " special thanks to suying yang who sent a very useful page from walsh 's _ making tex work _ . here it is : tex and the other programs mentioned in this book are available from a number of places . it 's impossible to list all of the places where you might find any given tool , but there is one place where you will almost certainly find every tool : the comprehensive tex archive network ( ctan ) . this network is a fully-mirrored anonymous ftp hierarchy on three continents . always use the ftp site that is geographically closest to you . the following table lists the current members of ctan as of july 1993 : % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % location site ip address top level directory united states ftp . shsu . edu 192 . 92 . 115 . 10 / tex-archive england ftp . tex . ac . uk 131 . 151 . 79 . 32 / tex-archive germany ftp . uni-stuugart . de 129 . 69 . 8 . 13 / tex-archive % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % you may also access the ctan archives by electronic mail if you do not have ftp access . for up-to - date instructions about the mail server , send the single-line message help to : fileserv @ shsu . edu . where are the files ? every ctan mirror site has the same well-organized directory structure . the top-level directory also contains a complete catalog of current files organized by name , date , and size . the catalogs are named files . byname , files . bydate , and files . bysize , respectively , in the top level directory . the top-level directory contains the following subdirectories : % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % directory description of contents tools archiving tools ( unzip , tar , compress , etc . ) biblio tools for maintaining bibliographic databases digests electronic digests ( texhax , uktex , etc . ) info free documentation , many good guides dviware printing and previewing software fonts fonts fo tex graphics software for working with pictures and figures help online help files , etc . indexing indexing and glossary building tools language multi - national language support macros macro packages and stule files misc stuff that does n't fit in any other category support tools for running and supporting tex systems os - specific programs and files web sources for tex programs ( in web ) % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % the archives at ftp . shsu . edu and ftp . tex . ac . uk also support gopher access to the archives . the uk gopher supports indexed access to the archives . a world wide web ( hypertext ) interface to the archives is available from : http : / / jasper . ora . com / ctan / ctan . html this interface includes brief descriptions of many packages and the ability to perform keyword and date searches . 2 ) the unix option : - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - many have pointed out that i could run linux ( freely distributed unix clone ) on my pc , and that it has great tex support ( ntex 1 . 3 ) . this turned out to be impractical for me . but it is an option i did not know existed : " check out freebsd , freely downloadable from ftp . freebsd . org , or available as a cdrom from cdrom . com ( about $ 40 or less ) . you can maintain dos and unix on the same hardware and switch between the two , and therefore have your latex , too . " 3 ) the commercial option : - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - " there is a commercial version of ( la ) tex available for pcs from y&y , who just today have announced a sales-help @ yandy . com ( among other addresses ) .

" for info on truetex email richard j . kinch ( kinch @ netcom . com ) ; for info on y&y tex email louis vosloo ( 71172 . 524 @ compuserve . com ) . both are in the $ 400 - - 500 area from memory . seemed to me that y&y tex was a bit more abreast of changes ( like latex 2e ) than truetex but you 'd be best to get info from both of course to make up your own mind . " 4 ) latex on the mac - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - " if you are not set on an intel - based processor , oztex 1 . 8 is the best shareware version for the mac , while textures ( from blue sky ) is a highly regarded commercial implementation . " " i ' ve used textures for years on a mac and still have n't seen anything to compare in terms of ease of integration of graphics . " 5 ) emtex - - - - - - - - - emtex seems to be the overall favorite for dos machines . it is said to be much more widely used ( than gtex ) and easier to install . a summary of how you can get it : " the most painless way to get latex on your pc is to download emtex from the university of georgia ( ai . uga . edu , / pub / emtex ) . we give additional installation instructions besides those provided by the author . " other cites : ftp . rus . uni-stuttgart . de / pub / tex / sytems / msdos / emtex and emtex-fonts ponder . csci . unt . edu [ 129 . 120 . 3 . 16 ] pub / tex / emtex ymir . claremont . edu [ 134 . 173 . 4 . 23 ] [ anonymous . tex . ibm _ pc . emtex ] there was also a particular enthusiastic endorsment of emtex for emacs users on os / 2 : " i use the os / 2 version [ of emtex ] which is truly excellent ( not being limited by memory , it is much better than the dos version ) . there are also available for os / 2 , a graphical dvi viewer ( dvipm ) , ghostscript , dvips , etc . in addition , em has ported gnu emacs to os / 2 ( the current version is 19 . 27 ) . imho , if you are going to work in latex , you should be using emacs in latex mode as your editor . emacs + emtex under os / 2 has pretty much supplanted other use of word processing software " 6 ) gtex - - - - - - - - the gtex package was said to be more complete ( amslatex , amstex , dviwin etc . ) and more windows - friendly than emtex . this is , more or less , what sold me on it . i got it from : gtex ftp . shsu . edu / tex-archive / systems / msdos / gtex1 . 0 for ms windows / dos users . microemacs for windows is the host interface whose menus allow easy access to tex / metafont / amspell / bibtex / etc . also included are complete macro sets for plain tex , latex , nfss , e - tex , amslatex , and amstex . one person who responded to my query commented that gtex is less mature than emtex . i must say that he is probably right . installation took me much longer than i anticipated . here is a summary of the problems and their workarounds : 1 ) to begin with , the main tex . exe in the base directory does not accept arguments . i may have missed something , but i could not make latex work by the standard $ ) tex &lplain ( file-name > what i got was simply the tex environment . i could , of course , load lplain at this point and then load my file . but this is rather cumbersome . i found a workaround through micro-emacs , which is part of the package . 2 ) i did n't realize that if you unzip latex2e after unzipping latex , you clobber some of the latex 2 . 09 . sty files ( and you cannot use latex 2 . 09 as a result ) . there is a ( rather complex ) workaround and if you need latex2e only to begin with you are in good shape . however , it turned out that when you run latex2e . bat in the texfmts directory ( to generate the . fmt file for latex2e ) the name of the fmt file is latex . fmt , but it turned out that micro-emacs package expects a totally different fmt file for latex2e , namely a file called nfss2ltx . fmt . even changing the relevant bat file does not solve the problem . the only workaround i could find was to copy latex . fmt as nfss2ltx . fmt ( in short , if you do n't want the hassle , install latex only ) . 3 ) the dviwin package for both previewing and printing ( written by hipocrates sendoukas ) is rather nice . the feature that generates missing fonts automatically is particularly useful if your disk space is limited . however setting this option to work right was difficult and the documentation is not very helpful . if you run under windows nt ( as i do ) this is what you need to do : o select options / missing fonts . . . o select the third option ( append line to file and execute command ) o in the line text box write : call genpk $ f $ m $ x $ y $ x $ y $ d $ p $ e o in the file text box write : x : \ ( temp-dir ) \ < batch-file . bat > where x : is your hard drive , temp-dir is the value of your temp environment variable and batch-file is an arbitrary name for a batch file that will generatte missing fonts . for example , i use the following text : c : \ temp \ missing . bat o in the cmd text box write : genallnt . bat $ ( temp ) \ missing . bat where temp is the environment variable that contains the name of the directory in the file text box . note that in the cmd text box you need to use an environment variable ( you have to ) while in the file text box you cannot ( you must specify the literal name of the temp directory ) . it took me a while to figure this out and it was n't fun . if you do it wrong , dviwin takes control over your entire operating system , firing up and killing dos widows in rapid succession . you cannot even use nt 's task list to kill the runaway process .
<subject> foreign language in ads </subject> sorry to be delayed in getting a summary back on the foreign language in the recent ibm ads . as usual , lots of linguist list readers came through with the goods . ( individual thanks are at the end of this message ) . here are the responses i received : the old gentlemen walking along the river are speaking french ( there was some disagreement as to whether it was parisian french or not , with people coming down on both sides ) ; the businessmen in the marketplace are speaking moroccan arabic ; the majority opinion was that the nuns are speaking czech ( though a couple of people felt it was polish ) . i ' ve seen one ad since then which i ' m pretty sure is in greek ( people on a fishing boat ) , because one of the subtitles contains mention of drachmas . if i ' m wrong about that , i 'd like to know , needless to say . those of you who expressed interest in seeing some of our research , i have n't forgotten you ! i ' ve just been buried in administrative stuff lately . i ' ll try to do something about getting it off over spring break , which is in a couple of weeks . if you do n't see something in the next few weeks , you might want to drop me another line at renryder @ idbsu . idbsu . edu . finally , very hearfelt thanks to everyone who wrote ( i hope i have n't left anyone off this list ) : eva wyss , daniel keller , marc picard , laila lalami , john koontz , dana slancova , gary h . toops , marlene abrams miller , guerssel mohamed , frits stuurman , chris miller , greenman , younes mourchid , tim beasley , james kirchner , paul woods , jussi karlgren , marc eisinger , michael kac , rebecca larche moreton , carl woolhiser , anton sherwood , elabbas benmamoun , karin ryding , elizabeth bergman , kirk belnap ( ? ) , reinier post . if anyone wants the addresses of any of these people to discuss the language id with them further , i have them ; i just did n't want to make this message any longer than necessary . thanks to everyone ! mary ellen ryder
<subject> sum : jakobson reference </subject> two months ago ( sorry for the delay ) i posted the following query on the linguist list ( with a horrible spelling error in the subject line ) : ) the following is , i believe , a more or less literal quote from roman jakobson : ) languages differ less in what you can express in them than in what you must ) > express in them . ) does anybody out there have the exact reference ? 1 . reaction to the query = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = six hours later it appeared on the list and three more hours later the first answer was in ! ! ! thank you all , that 's really great ! ! ! within the following four weeks i received ten replies , 5 of them giving the first quotation below , 2 with the second one , 3 asking me to forward the requested information . thanks to all who responded : birgitta englund dimitrova bob fradkin eloise jelinek hans lindquist nili mandelblit bruce mannheim bert peeters larry rosenwald deborah ruuskanen martha thunes 2 . answers = = = = = = = = = = a . the first quotation is : jakobson , roman ( 1959 ) ' on linguistic aspects of translation ' in reuben a . brower ( ed . ) , on translation , cambridge , mass . : harvard university , press . 232-239 . reprint new york : galaxy books 1966 . the quoted sentence is on p . 236 . also in jakobson , roman ( 1971 ) selected writings vol . ii , the hague : mouton . 260-266 . the quoted sentence is here on p . 264 . ( birgitta englund dimitrova mentions that this article has ever since been widely quoted in research on translation . ) the context is the division of labor between lexical and grammatical means , which may vary considerably from language to language , and the problems this poses for translation : " if some grammatical category is absent in a given language , its meaning may be translated into this language by lexical means . . . . it is more difficult to remain faithful to the original when we translate into a language provided with a certain grammatical category from a language devoid of such a category . . . . as boas neatly observed , the grammatical pattern of a language ( as opposed to its lexical stock ) determines those aspects of each experience that must be expressed in the given language . . . . in order to translate accurately the english sentence " i hired a worker , " a russian needs supplementary information , whether this action was completed or not and whether the worker was a man or a woman . . . ) languages differ essentially in what they _ must _ convey and not in what they ) > _ may _ convey . each verb of a given language imperatively raises a set of specific yes-no - questions . . . " b . the second quotation is : jakobson , roman ( 1959 ) ' boas ' view of grammatical meaning ' in w . goldschmidt ( ed . ) , the anthropology of franz boas , memoirs of the american anthropological association 89 . 139-45 . reprinted in jakobson , roman ( 1971 ) selected writings vol . ii , the hague : mouton . 489-496 . the quoted sentence is on p . 492 . here the context is boas ' obligatoriness criterion for the distinction between grammatical and lexical meaning . jakobson quotes from boas : " . . . ' a paucity of obligatory aspects does not by any means imply obscurity of speech . when necessary , clarity can be obtained by adding explanatory words . ' to denote time or plurality , those languages which have no tense or grammatical number resort to lexical means . ) thus the true difference between languages is not in what may or may not be ) > expressed but in what must or must not be conveyed by the speakers . " ( am i right as a non-native speaker of english in suspecting that my fellow non-native speaker has possibly confounded ' must not ' with ' need not ' ? ) 3 . motivation for the query = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = i am using the ( first ) quote in a typological context , as motto for a paper where i discuss some of the consequences the obligatoriness of definiteness and number marking has for those cases of use where the speaker wants to evade these constraints . i argue there that languages with a high degree of explicitness ( many obligatory choices ) also provide for standard weakening strategies . if any typologist out there wants to engage in a discussion about the explicitness parameter , i would be happy to hear from him . to trigger the appropriate keywords , let me just mention that james huang 's ' temperature ' parameter ( the metaphor goes back , via haj ross , to marshall mcluhan ) is just a special case of the explicitness parameter . according to huang ( li 15 , 1984 , pp . 531-574 ) , languages with a high degree of obligatoriness in the expression of anaphoric elements are ' hot ' ( little audience participation required ) , whereas languages with a preference for zero anaphora are ' cool ' ( more audience participation required ) . let me conclude with another quote from the first paper of rj : " equivalence in difference is the cardinal problem of language and the pivotal concern of linguistics .

<subject> est-ce que questions </subject> several weeks ago , i ' ve sent an inquiry about is it that / est-ce que interrogatives to the list . many of you took the time to answer to it , so i feel very sorry for not giving any summary of the replies before today . i have written one in french , which i display here . if some of you would like a translation , please ask and i ' ll write one . thanks again for your precious collaboration ! the inquiry was : j ' ai rencontre l ' enonce authentique suivant : why is it that ( people are never happy ) ? qui ressemble beaucoup au fran ais : pourquoi est-ce que ( les gens ne sont jamais contents ) ? j ' aimerais savoir s ' il est possible de poser une question de la meme maniere avec : what , who , when , where or how ? what is it that you said / are saying ? who is it that you met / are meeting ? when is it that you met / are meeting her ? how is it that you did / do this ? where is it that you were / are ? sur les 54 reponses obtenues , 21 consistent en une phrase : " tous ces exemples me paraissent acceptables et normaux " . les auteurs des autres reponses ont tres majoritairement accepte tous les exemples egalement , mais avec quelques restrictions d ' emploi que nous developpons ici . les quatre grands types de restrictions sont le registre de langue employe , la semantique de l ' interrogative , la nature de l ' adverbe interrogatif et le temps du verbe etre place avant ' it that ' . 1 . le registre employe est juge pertinent pour l ' acceptabilite de la structure , comme le montrent les six remarques suivantes : " alors que les phrases proposees seraient appropriees dans un registre tres formel , des equivalents plus courants [ colloquial ] seraient : you said / are saying whatj ? you met / are meeting whoj ? you met / are meeting her whenj ? you did / do this howj ? you were / are where j ? cet equivalent ' courant ' n ' existe pas cependant avec why . je dirais plutot : people never seem to be happy . why ( is that ) j ? " " why is it that convient mais ne semble pas tres naturel ; l ' emploi de ' that ' marque un registre plus formel . " " les exemples semblent appropries dans tous les registres , peut-etre un peu moins frequents dans un ecrit tres formel . " " toutes ces questions sont parfaitement ordinaires . " " j ' attribue ces phrases au registre courant [ colloquial ] plutot que litteraire . " " je dirais que ces phrases seraient acceptees par n ' importe quel locuteur americanophone , au moins dans une conversation informelle . " les commentaires divergent , certains locuteurs attribuant les exemples a un registre formel , d ' autres a un registre non formel . la premiere personne optant pour le registre formel precise que ce type d ' enonce est caracteristique d ' une question que poserait par exemple un avocat au cours d ' un proces ; mais c ' est peut-etre plutot la semantique de la question qui importe ici , et non le registre . la deuxieme personne ayant choisi le registre formel semble cependant s ' appuyer surtout sur la presence de that . en effet , une autre reponse souligne la difference existant entre les formes ' why is it ' et ' why is it that ' . par consequent nous pouvons retenir des commentaires obtenus que la construction qui nous interesse releve globalement d ' un registre courant - voire familier - mais peut se retrouver dans d ' autres registres sous certaines formes ( avec that vs sans that ) et pour exprimer certains actes de parole . 2 . la semantique de l ' interrogative intervient elle aussi dans le choix de cette construction , comme l ' attestent les 13 remarques suivantes : " par rapport a la construction plus traditionnelle , celle-ci se limite aux cas ou le locuteur exprime une repetition ou une clarification apres avoir pose la question sous la forme plus courante : me : what did you sayj ? you : i said " goodbye and good riddancej ! " me : what is it that you saidj ? i was n't listening closely . " " cette construction marquee n ' est appropriee que si le discours precedent a deja etabli qu ' il y aura une reponse non negative a la question . ainsi , l ' echange suivant ne semblerait pas naturel : - who is it that you sawj ? - nobody . " " je n ' accepterais pas ou reagirais negativement a la phrase how is it that you did thatj ? . j ' emploie cette construction avec tous les autres adverbes ( where , who , what , when ) pour obtenir un eclaircissement a propos d ' une chose deja mentionnee . " " les exemples me semblent normaux si le locuteur met l ' accent sur l ' adverbe interrogatif et exprime une certaine exasperation : what is that thing you boughtj ? " " ces questions sont tout a fait acceptables , moyennant un contexte discursif particulier du type reprise . d ' ou la meilleure acceptabilite des versions dans lesquelles le verbe est marque de l ' aspect be + ing ( fondamentalement anaphorique ) . " " cette construction met l ' emphase sur l ' element interrogatif . " " spontanement , je dirais que cette construction se focalise sur la question plus specifiquement . si l ' on me demandait : who are you meetingj ? je pourrais repondre : a friend . mais si la question etait : who is it that you ' re meetingj ? je me sentirais oblige de repondre plus precisement . " " la seule raison justifiant l ' emploi de cette construction est , a mon avis , l ' emphase qu ' elle met sur l ' objet de la question . " " en anglais , ces questions sont posees de fa on rhetorique ou pour exprimer une demande de clarification . dans le deuxieme cas , l ' element interrogatif est fortement accentue . " " la plupart de ces questions ressemblent a une demande de repetition de quelque chose qui aurait ete mal compris a la premiere audition . " " les questions de ce type correspondent a la forme declarative emphatique it is because of x that ou it is x that i am saying ( . . . ) . ces questions en anglais se traduiraient mieux en fran ais par quelque chose comme : qui c ' est que tu as vuj ? qui met aussi l ' accent sur la reponse la ou une question en est-ce que normale ne le ferait pas . cette construction entra ne aussi une accentuation plus forte sur l ' element interrogatif . " " dans beaucoup de cas , ces formes marqueraient une emphase utilisee par exemple si je pensais avoir mal compris un message : where is it that you [ said you ] arej ? " " pour moi , ces constructions presupposent que quelqu ' un vous a donne l ' information ( what , who , when ou where ) et que vous l ' avez oubliee et devez poser une question sur ce seul element . " toutes ces remarques s ' accordent pour attribuer a la construction qui nous interesse un sens emphatique utilise pour obtenir une clarification . elle semble aussi s ' accompagner d ' une accentuation de l ' element interrogatif . il est donc interessant de remarquer que la valeur emphatique est commune aux constructions anglaise et fran aise . 3 . parmi les 54 reponses , 11 tentaient d ' expliquer partiellement ou completement la variation de l ' acceptabilite de la construction en fonction de la nature de l ' adverbe interrogatif : " where is it that you arej ? et how is it that you do thisj ? sont pour moi les constructions les plus maladroites et les moins frequentes . " " where is it that you arej ? est maladroit ; je repeterais probablement la question where are youj ? en accentuant plus le where . " " je ne pense pas que le that dans why is it that soit le meme que dans les constructions avec les adverbes interrogatifs . " " why is it et how is it sont toujours idiomatiques , meme s ' ils sont plutot formels . when is it est idiomatique , mais para t assez pauvre . les autres enonces identifieraient a coup sur le locuteur comme etant etranger . " " toutes ces constructions sont possibles , excepte celle avec how . " " pour what , who , when et where , je peux employer is it seulement avec le present ; avec le passe je dirais was it . pour how c ' est different parce que how is it est une forme idiomatique signifiant pourquoi pour moi . donc how is it that you did thisj ? convient si cela signifie pourquoi as-tu fait celaj ? . si je veux vraiment savoir comment , alors le temps doit correspondre comme avec les autres adverbes interrogatifs . " " les constructions avec what , who et when sont acceptables , mais celles avec how et where ne semblent pas tres naturelles . " " toutes les constructions me conviennent ( sauf peut-etre la derniere avec where , qui me para t bizarre ) . " " je pense qu ' il ne serait pas approprie d ' employer is it that dans aucune des situations mentionnees , excepte why is it that . . " " j ' utiliserais cette construction avec when seulement s ' il etait suivi de was it ; je ne l ' emploierais pas avec how et where . " " tous les exemples cites sont acceptables mais , mise a part la question avec why ( et peut-etre celle avec how ) , ils ne semblent pas aussi generaux que la question ordinaire [ unmarked ] . " pour des raisons qui leur sont probablement propres , why , how et where se distinguent des autres adverbes . how is it peut s ' interpreter a la fois comme une forme figee qui a le sens de pourquoi ( = how come ) , et comme une construction non figee signifiant comment . . cela explique les differences de perception de cette forme par les locuteurs , qui n ' ont pas toujours pris en compte ses deux sens . why is it a egalement un comportement de forme figee , mais qui garde le sens de pourquoi . pourquoi est aussi un adverbe qui se demarque des autres en fran ais , car la question qu ' il pose porte sur l ' ensemble de la phrase ( pourquoi tu t ' en vasj ? mais * tu t ' en vas pourquoij ? ) . nous expliquons moins facilement la specificite de where qui a ete relevee a 5 reprises . 4 . le dernier facteur d ' acceptabilite egalement souvent cite ( huit fois ) par les natifs est le temps du verbe etre place avant it that . : " toutes ces phrases s ' emploient couramment en anglais . a noter qu ' on peut aussi bien utiliser ce genre de structure au passe : where was it that you ran into him yesterdayj ? " " nous formons souvent des enonces come ceux que vous citez , par exemple : who was it who split ink on your book ? why was it that he was late ? who did we say was coming at 8 o ' clock ? etc . " " pour what , who , when et where , je peux employer is it seulement avec le present ; avec le passe je dirais was it . [ pour ] how is it that you did thisj ? , et si je veux vraiment savoir comment , alors le temps doit correspondre comme avec les autres adverbes interrogatifs . " " toutes les phrases me conviennent , meme si dans plusieurs cas j ' ai pense qu ' il y avait une meilleure alternative : what is it that you said / are saying ? ) aussi : what was it that you said ? who is it that you met / are meeting ? ) aussi : who was it that you met ? when is it that you met / are meeting her ? ) avec " met " , " when was it that you met " est meilleur . how is it that you did / do this ? ) aussi : how was it that you did that ? where is it that you were / are ? ) avec " were " , " where was it that you were " est meilleur . " " toutes les phrases sont bonnes . elles seraient un peu meilleures si les temps des verbes s ' accordaient . " " les questions conviennent toutes , tant que le temps employe est correct . " " quand l ' anglais emploie l ' expression is it that , les temps des verbes doivent correspondre dans la plupart des cas . " " toutes les phrases sont parfaitement correctes , sauf que normalement j ' accorderais le temps du premier verbe a celui du second lorsque deuxieme la portion de la phrase est au passe . par exemple : who was it that you met ? ( but ) who is it that you are meeting ? when was it that you met her ? ( but ) when is it that you are meeting her ? . " nous pouvons sur ce point differencier les constructions ' is it that ' et ' est-ce que ' , la construction de l ' anglais etant beaucoup moins figee que celle du fran ais . en effet , le fran ais n ' accorderait pas les temps des deux verbes .

<subject> summary : expletive negation in modern hebrew </subject> on february 27 , i posted a querry on expletive negation in modern hebrew . i want to thank ariel cohen ( ariel _ cohen @ riga . mt . cs . cmu . edu ) , michael ephratt ( rhlh702 @ uvm . haifa . ac . il ) , bob fradkin ( raf100f @ oduvm . cc . odu . edu ) , laurence horn ( lhorn @ yalevm . cis . yale . edu ) , paul rowlett ( p . a . rowlett @ mod - lang . salford . ac . uk ) and lucia tovena ( tovena @ latl . unige . ch ) for their comments . my querry originated from michael moore 's comment to the effect that in modern hebrew , the sentence negation of subordinate clauses dominated by before , until and i ' m afraid can be interpreted referentially or expletively . according to ariel cohen , only until contexts allow an expletive negation . bob fradkin mentionned that expletive negation in mh seemed less frequent than in french . while it seems that expletive negation in mh has a narrower domain of use than in french , there might also be a question of style involved here ; while expletive negation is an aknowledged grammatical feature of formal style in french , it might be a non-standard feature of mh . this is suggested to me by the fact that neither glinert 1989 suggested by michael ephratt nor rosen 1977 even mention expletive negation in mh . lucia tovena pointed me to her 1994 paper in geneva generative papers about italian , hungarian and hindi expletive negation in until contexts . for a typological overview of expletive negation , one can consult horn 1978 , which shows the typological extension of the phenomenon . now , i ' m still left with a few unanswered questions . i ' m surprised that there apparently does n't exist any study on the topic in mh . i wonder whether i should be looking in the direction of ancient hebrew . a question of more general interest is how to deal with divergent distributions of a phenomenon across languages ; in other words , how should the fact that expletive negation exists in comparative and fearing contexts in a large number of languages but not in mh ? ? could matters of style , as suggested above , explain this ? ? thanks for those who responded and for those who will . - glinert , l . , 1989 , the grammar of modern hebrew , cambridge up . - horn , l . , 1978 , some aspects of negation , j . greenberg , universals of human language , vol . 4 , standford up , 127-210 . - moore , m . , 1992 , double negation , et cetera , 304-309 . - rosen , 1977 , contemporary hebrew . pierre larrivee departement de langues et linguistique , universite laval , quebec , canada , g1k 7p4 3914larp @ vm1 . ulaval . ca

<subject> materials to learn luganda </subject> i ' m inquiring for a somewhat linguistically savvy undergraduate who will be spending this june - november in kampala : what is there available in the way of books , a / v materials , courses , whatever for learning luganda ? thanks . george huttar huttar @ sil . org
<subject> queries </subject> in a reference i can no longer identify , i recall coming across an assertion that the accent with which east indians speak english arose as a result of the teachers of english in india during the major period of british colonialism there were from wales . as a result , indians were originally taught english with a welsh accent , a happenstance of linguistic accidnet perpetuated through succeeding generations . is ther any truth to this ? does anyone out there know the origins of this ? further - - are there any studies on characteristics of national accents in foreign tongues ( eg . is there a relationship between the characteristic accent with which italians speak english and , say , the way in which they might speak russian ; or the english person 's accent in speaking spanish or in speaking french , for instance ) . finally - - a medico-linguistic query . in older medical text - books which listening to the chest with a stethoscope , the physician is instructed to tell the patient to enunciate " ninety-nine . " this actually makes very little sense . the origin apparently is from an early translation from the german in which the german term-equivalent used in the original text for what was translated as " ninety-nine " does involve strong expirations and so is a useful tool in examination . again - - does anyone out there have any info on this ? to complicate things further - - i am a biologist and not a linguist and am not on this list ! so i would greatly apprciate it you could communicate with me directly : shodell @ aurora . liunet . edu very many thanks for reading this far and for any help you might be able to offer - - mike shodell
<subject> the ipa market </subject> " alexis mr " urges that phonetic alphabets be standardized , and writes , " why not let the invisible hand of the " market " of ideas operate freely ? " but the market * is * operating . that 's exactly why we have several different systems , any that 's why people feel free to modify those systems as they please . i do not see how the market would demand i asked in an earlier egram ( vol-6 - 199 ) why it would benefit me , as an active fieldworker , to have a completely revamped phonetic alphabet . i am still waiting for a plausible answer . i am happy with ipa most of the time , and when i ' m not i innovate as necessary . a complete overhaul would be wrenching for me and probably leave me feeling extremely alientated . more likely , i would just go on using the ipa and chinese ipa symbols i already use , and the dubious goal of a new , unified standard phonetic system would fail . i think the real reason some people want to overhaul ipa is to alter its aesthetics - to make it neater , more symmetrical somehow . i do not see any practical value in this . nor do i see any need to have a single , unified system , replacing both ipa and american consensual practice . everybody recognizes esh , and everybody recognizes s-hachek , and if a letter _ y _ appears in a transcription you look carefully at the introduction and find out what it represents , that 's all . where is the problem ? please , someone tell me , where is the problem ? david prager branner , yuen ren society asian l&l , do-21 , university of washington seattle , wa 98195 ( charmii @ u . washington . edu )
<subject> re : 6 . 389 sum : history of capitalisation in english </subject> i believe that at one time all nouns were capped in english as they still are in german . you may find something of interest in my paper on the capping of ethnic names in the just published centennial usage studies , pads . as i recall , nunberg tries to map out a descriptive theory of punctuation and says little if anything about caps ( almost no one says anything about them but there are a few works reference in th bibliography to my article . bob wachal
<subject> re : 6 . 389 sum : history of capitalisation in english </subject> just a quick one before everyone else gets in . two germanic languages , at least , dutch and standard german , use a captalised pronoun form for the polite second - person use : ' u ' in dutch , ' sie ' in german . i guess the explanation for this is respect , just as pronominal references to the deity are capitalised by many . in modern netherlands dutch , this is disappearing , and ' u ' is used , whereas in belgian dutch ( flemish ) , i have the impression it 's retained much more ( as is the use of ' u ' itself - in netherlands dutch , i believe that ' u ' is beginning to be restricted to formal , rather than merely polite , usage , whereas in belgium , people use ' u ' with each other for much longer - i even heard my children calling their friends , aged around 10 , ' u ' , and they ' re not notably polite ) . the explanation for capitalised ' i ' in english can't be respect - i suspect it 's merely typographical , having to do with the fact that lower-case ' i ' is so small . paul werth
<subject> affricates - - one segment or two </subject> the recent query and summary by larry trask on german affricates makes me think of the fact that , unless i am mistaken , it is perfectly easy to hear the difference between one - and two-segment stop-fricative sequences at least in some cases . polish has a contrast of this sort at least in initial position , where the words spelled _ trzy _ and _ czy _ differ only in that the former has a cluster , the second an affricate . also , if you compare the english way of saying _ ts _ with the german way of saying _ z _ ( or the polish or the yiddish , etc . ) , there is an audible difference . most english speakers ' rendition of _ matzah _ ( or _ matzoh _ ) for example sounds quite different from the yiddish or polish , but ( and this is also very suggestive ) i have found a few am . engl . speakers ( not all of them jewish , by the way ) who have the affricate , i . e . , one-segment / ts / in this and perhaps some other yiddish borrowings but the two segment / t / + / s / otherwise , so that these speakers do not rhyme _ matzah _ and _ lots o ( f ) _ , whereas most speakers do . finally , i think some speakers have a one-segment / ts / in hit ya , but a two-segment / t / + / s / in hits ya , although most speakers i have asked refuse to admit anything but the nonpalatalized , non-affricated pronunciation in the second case . alexis mr

<subject> query : chinese grammatical markers </subject> i ' m interested in any information regarding the diachronic development of the following grammatical markers in various chinese languages ( apologies for the email-mutilated transcriptions ) : ( 1 ) mandarin : [ de ] ( the " genitive " / " relative " marker ) ( 2 ) mandarin : [ ge ] ( the general numeral classifier ) ( 3 ) shanghainese : [ ge ] ( the " genitive " / " relative " marker ) ( 4 ) hokkien : [ e ] ( a ) ( the " genitive " / " relative " marker ) ( b ) ( the general numeral classifier ) ( 5 ) teochew : [ kai ] ( a ) ( the " genitive " / " relative " marker ) ( b ) ( the general numeral classifier ) ( 6 ) cantonese : [ ge ] ( the " genitive " / " relative " marker ) [ go ] ( the general numeral classifier ) [ dik ] ( the ligature ) more specifically : question 1 : which of the above markers are historically / etymologically related to which others , ie . deriving from a diachronically reconstructable common source ? ( eg . are mandarin [ de ] and cantonese [ dik ] diachronically related ? , etc . etc . ) question 2 : ( specific to hokkien and teochew ) most native speakers of hokkien and teochew , who are also speakers of mandarin , are of the opinion that there are two distinct markers exhibiting accidental homophony : a " genitive " / " relative " [ e ] / [ kai ] corresponding to mandarin [ de ] , and a " classifier " [ e ] / [ kai ] corresponding to mandarin [ ge ] . question 2a : is it demonstrably the case that [ e ] and [ kai ] are the respective products of diachronic coalescence of distinct forms at some earlier stage of the language ? question 2b : are there any valid synchronic arguments for positing two distinct lexical items , ie . two [ e ] 's in hokkien , and two [ kai ] 's in teochew ? ( i consider the choice of characters conventionally used to represent these markers as irrelevant . ) note : i am a general linguist , not a sinologist , and i do n't read or speak chinese . i would greatly appreciate either your own views on the above questions , or references to published works addressing these questions . however , if the references happen to be in chinese , i would be extremely grateful if you could provide a synopsis of their contents . thanks , david gil national university of singapore ellgild @ nusvm . bitnet

<subject> linguist nameserver </subject> the linguists nameserver - plea as many of you will know we maintain a nameserver for linguists and related scientists at linguist @ alf . let . uva . nl . this nameserver contains around 7500 e-mail addresses of persons and institutions , as well as institutional fax addresses . as with all such lists the addresses rapidly become out of date , as people change jobs , or computer centres change computers . to reduce the number of ghost adddresses , and add linguists to the list whose e-mail addresses are not presently contained in it , i would encourage all direct and indirect subscribers to linguist to check that their address ( es ) are still valid . three commands are relevant in this context : list this command enables one or more addresses to be extracted from the database . the correct syntax to extract bill clinton 's address ( just an example ) would be : list clinton this command should be sent to linguists @ alf . let . uva . nl remove this command enables a single address to be removed . the correct syntax is : remove clinton , bill : clinton @ ovalroom . whitehouse . gov add this command enables a single address to be added . the correct syntax is : add clinton , bill : clinton @ ovalroom . whitehouse . gov to change an address you require both a remove and an add operation . any combination of commands is acceptible as long each is given on a separate line . there is no restriction to one command per message . so 150 separate add commands in one message is quite acceptible . we would ask that people do not use capital letters in addresses - these are never essential . the reason for us to ask this at the present is that we will be transferring operations in the near future from the vax on which linguists is now maintained to a new unix system . this will also enable us to improve our service with new possibilities . norval smith pieter masereeuw

<subject> re : 6 . 381 words that are their own opposites </subject> several people submitted " overlook " and " oversight " , which are fine examples of this phenomenon in english ( though i think that mary neff 's " outgoing : retiring " is perhaps the most elegant submission to date . ) perhaps my current work on the various shades of meaning in english prepositions has biased me , but in any case i think that the difference in the various senses of " oversight " and " overlook " stems largely from their compounding with " over - " . " over " is sneaky ; at first glance it seems to be fairly limited in expressive power , but deeper analysis reveals that in it lurk a number of distinctions of meaning , some of them quite subtle indeed . in addition to nuances of physical location , " over " can indicate power relationships ( both outright force , and more subtle authority ) , value judgements , and the general notion of ( metaphorically ) moving on to another thing , as in " get over it " and " skip over " . so my analysis of " oversight " and " overlook " would be that in one sense , " over " takes on the meaning of authority-over , and in the other sense it takes on the meaning of skipping-over . perhaps a similar argument could be make for the " sight / see / look " part of the compound ? for instance , useages such as " see to it " " look to your own interest " seem to carry some of this " authority " meaning . i think the " over " analysis is more clear-cut , but it would be interesting to see if someone will make a case for the other half . - - marion kee marion kee | all opinions are my own ; knowledge engineer , center for machine translation | when cmu wants my opinions carnegie mellon university pittsburgh , pa , usa | it pays for them .

<subject> words that are their own opposites </subject> st isidore of seville may well be the source of " lucus a non lucendo , " as paul werth suggests . however , it 's no accident that benji wald attributed this ' etymology ' to varro ( 116-27 b . c . e . ) , as the latter is responsible for such etymological gems as vallum . . . quod ea varicare nemo posset " _ vallum _ ' camp wall ' because no one could _ varicare _ 's traddle over it ' " ( _ de lingua latina _ : v , 117 ) and qua vix agi potest , hinc angiportum ; qua nil potest agi , hinc angulus " where it is hardly possible for anything _ agi _ ' to be driven , ' from this it is called an _ angiportum _ ' alley ' ; where nothing can _ agi _ ' be driven , ' from this it is an _ angulus _ ' corner ' " ( ibid . : vi , 41 ) . a footnote in the loeb edition of _ de lingua latina _ refers to this as " derivation by the contrary meaning , " and cites another example : ludus , in quo minime luditur " school , in which there is very little playing " ( festus , 122 . 16m ) . karen baumer yale university

" lepschy also writes that abel 's ideas " were taken seriously by people of the calibre of pott , steinthal , and schuchardt " , and that freud repeatedly quoted abel 's work , viewing it " as a linguistic confirmation " of his own theory that " for the unconscious , opposites are equivalent to each other .

<subject> summary : whatever happened to 'd ? </subject> a few weeks ago i posted a query to the list regarding the disappearance of had or its contracted form ' d , in such expressions as she better stop , which appeared in a recent academic publication . i questioned people 's attitudes towards the standardisation of this new form ( better ) , the subsequent status of the bare infinitive ( stop ) , the possibility of its association with the extraposed construction it is better that she stop , ( implying a subjunctive analysis of stop ) and the likelihood of substituting another adjective ( e . g . good ) in place of better has a result of this . i also questioned the possibility of inverting better with the subject in interrogatives , given the analysis of it as an auxiliary form . i received 26 replies , and i would like to thank the following people who sent their comments , and anyone who is yet to do so : tamara al - kasey ; eleanor olds batchelder ; jonathon berg ; claudia brugman ; marsha bundman ; ellen contini - morava ; max copperman ; john cowan ( logical language group ) david fertig ; frederik fouvry ; dorine houston ; marge jackman ; roger lass ; deborah d . kela ruuskanen ; james kirchner ; timothy miller ; catherine rudin ; raphael salkie ; alena sanusi ; hal schiffman ; jane simpson ; dan slobin ; frits stuurman ; larry trask ; ivan uemlianen ; max wheeler . of 18 replies to the question of standardisation , 9 replied that it was not to be considered standard , 9 thought that it was either normal , informal or ok , and 8 did not consider this question . nobody liked the analysis of stop as a subjunctive , 2 people considering that the extraposed derivation sounded educated or stilted . one reply considered that stop was an imperative form . four people replied that better was an auxiliary , 7 thought it was a modal or semi-modal , and 2 thought that the construction was simply idiomatic . john cowan made mention of the use of better in yiddish - influenced american english as a sentence prefix : ' better she should n't go ' . with regard to its inversion in interrogatives , 9 people considered sai was not ok , one person thought it ok to invert in tags , and only one person thought main clause sai sounded ok . i also want to thank frederik fouvry for his reference : " information based syntax and semantics " ( hpsg vol . 1 , pollard & sag , 1987 ) in which better is analysed as an auxiliary that does n't allow inversion ; and frits stuurman for his references and comments : in g . gazdar , g . pullum , & i . sag ( 1982 ) " auxiliaries and related phenomena in a restricted theory of phrase structure " _ language _ 59 , 3 : 591-638 , pp . 610-611 , there is a reference to aren ' t as a similar case ( aren ' t i vs . i aren ' t ) ; and in gazdar , e . klein , pullum & sag ( 1985 ) _ generalized phrase structure grammar _ ( cambridge , mass . : harvard up ) , p . 64 , and gazdar , pullum & sag ( 1982 ) , p . 611 , footnote 17 , there are references to different meanings of modals like shall and might when inverted for interrogatives . frits stuurman also cites a gpsg reference to the use of better in p . sells ( 1985 ) _ lectures on government - binding theory , generalized phrase structure grammar , and lexical - functional grammar _ ( stanford : csli ) , p . 93 . many people found analogies with other modals that do not invert , e . g . claudia brugman mentions the difficulty of inverting ' she has to stop ' ) * ' has she to stop ? ' and gotta is equally impossible to invert . james kirchner also mentions otta as a similar case . tamara al - kasey compares the negative and the affirmative interrogatives : * ' had she better stop ? ' and ' had n't she better stop ? ' suggesting that the latter is more acceptable . other interesting items were : the vp - deletion version , observed by max wheeler ' we better had ' ; and at least 2 people considered that had seems to return only for inversion for interrogatives . generally , the use of inversion of better + subject was considered more common in tags , especially amongst children or teenagers , and jane simpson thinks that the tag bettern ' t you is now appearing in australian english , with or without the preceding ' d . ivan uemlianen ( british speaker from northern england ) claims he had always used the tag ' bettern ' t i ? ' as a child , which had always struck him as not quite right , and had never heard of the had until he heard it being used in old films . dan slobin considers the use of had to be archaic , or from another variety or era , although the inversion ' better she go ? ' does not appear in the speech of american - english preschoolers in their data . one respondent did n't know where the had came from , and another reanalysed it as would , in the same way as it has been reanalysed in conditional protases . another suggestion was that it was analogous to a pluperfect auxiliary without tense . two replied that the expression she better stop was just an example of sloppy editing . there was little discussion of phonological processes , but , in particular , i found interesting the following comments by roger lass : " in my dialect anyhow ( new york city middle class ) , it 's certainly normal to say ( and sometimes , in less formal registers , to write ) , i better , you better , he better , we better , they better . . . observe though : all the pronouns end with a vowel , and there are alternative forms , e . g . i 'd better . . . though these are much less common . there is however another type , which is sometimes taken to be better but is n't : you [ b ] better , where there 's a sort of geminate or at least half-long consonant . the very fact that none of the syntactic things you mark with * or ? seem to occur would be an indication that there has not really been any kind of reanalysis , but rather an institutionalization of a fast-speech deletion and / or assimilation , which is creeping up into slower styles ( as often happens ) . in fact the construction itself is weird anyhow , since you had comparative does n't seem to exist , except in archaisms like ' i 'd liefer do that ' ( i can't use it , but i ' ve heard it ) . note also , it 's just occurred to me , that you do n't get deletion of - 'd in * i rather do that . . . " this last comment i think gives us plenty of scope for more discussion . debbie ziegeler
<subject> 8 - bit characters </subject> dear fellow linguists : in the past months i have read several postings to this list using languages other than english ( spanish , german , french , finnish , italian , etc . ) . i consider this situation absolutely delicious , as it adds that international flavour that our discipline is so proud of . as english is not my native tongue , i welcome and exercise my right to use my language in all contexts . however , the notorious difficulty that 8 - bit characters have to travel in the cyberspace has made it really hard to send texts that comply with the spelling conventions of these languages ( basically accented and umlauted vowels , greek letters and certain other symbols ) . this is not a big problem when you are just sending a relatively short e-message to a colleague who speaks the same language ( you just drop the accents and type plain vowels or capitals instead , for enye you type a plain " n " , etc . ) . the real trouble arises when you wish to send a more polished document such as a paper , an abstract , a conference posting , a bibliography , a draft of a thesis to a distant supervisor , etc . in most of these cases the spelling norms * are * crucial . the obvious solution is the coding of 8 - bit characters as sequences of 7 - bit characters . i think that this has become a common practice , but i do n't know whether there is a standard for these conversions . if this coding practice has not yet been the object of standardisation , i venture to propose one below . this proposal refers to the characters available in the extended character set on ibm pc - compatible computers ( i am not familiar with mac , but this could also be used in that system ) . i would like to stress the fact that it is not necessary to type the ( long ) document using the coding system , rather the file must typed as usual , with accented and umlauted vowels as well as the rest of the characters needed in the language , and just after that you make a copy of the file and on that copy you change the 8 - bit characters for 7 - bit sequences according to the table provided . this procedure is * not * manual , for this you use the search-and - replace facility normally available in your word processor or editor ( remember : the dos editor has it ) . this can be done for most languages in ten or fewer passes ( less than one minute , varying with the size of the file ) . it is important to let the recipient know that you have coded the file in this fashion . append a note at the beginnig of the document to that effect , with a suggestion to use the search-and - replace facility to make the reverse changes , as well as the table of changes and samples . feel free to edit ( and / or translate ) what follows if you wish to make the note shorter by including only what is pertinent for a given language . | a . model of a note :

<subject> sum : singapore english </subject> content - length : 4261 a couple of weeks ago , i asked the following question : ) many people would not regard s ' pore english as a " native " english . ) however , there are many speakers here who grew up speaking ) english , ) ie acquiring english as their first language ; though certainly it may be a ) somewhat different variety from the english spoken in britain or ) america . ) in this respect , what is the currently accepted way of classifying ) singapore english ? in particular , is it possible to say that it is not a ) native language given that some people have it as their first ) language ? three respondants believed that singapore english should be regarded as " native " if it is the first language learned ; while three others suggested " native " has other connotations or suggested other terms for the english of singapore . thus anthea fraser gupta said : i strongly feel that the term " native language " should be used to refer to the language ( s ) an individual first learns , and that any other definition , based on race , on ancestral language use , or geographical origin , is untenable . debbie ziegeler agreed with this view : most people i believe would classify a first language as a native language ( = mother tongue ) , and i think this is what anthea gupta had in mind when she said that english in singapore now has native speakers , and that approximately 20 % of singapore 's incoming schoolchildren have english as a native language and ms . faridah hudson said : i believe that any language that is learned by a child as its first language should be considered as the native language . granted that singapore english is not as well studied as british or american english , it is still a form of english . on the other hand , wen - chao li claims suggests that " native " does not just refer to the linguistic experience of the individual : i think the word " native " here refers not to whether or not people speak the variety as a native language , but is just a convenient label used to distinguish the english of britain and the us , where the language originated ( " native " in this sense ) , from the english of places like singapore , india , and many countries in africa , where although english is widely spoken as a native language , it is a language that had transplanted another in the last 200 years , a language that was introduced rather than one that 's been culturally and historically " native " . mario cal varela suggested the use of the term " localized forms of english " for new varieties such as that of singapore : the expression " localized forms of english " is often used . . . to refer to varieties of english that have developed peculiar characteristics ( nativized features ) because of being used in cultural settings different from the so-called native englishes . and rodrik wade prefers " new englishes " : a term that was popularised , if not introduced by platt , weber and ho ( 1984 ) for se and other similar varieties of english is ' new englishes ' . i have used this term when writing about south african black english although as yet this variety has few l1 speakers . i would like to thank all these respondants , as well as alan firth and benny lee for their useful references and umberto for his questions about the pronunciation involved . special thanks to my mentor david deterding for introducing me to the list and for helping me out with this summary . kia - sheng chew national technological university singapore 91a26936217f @ nievax . nie . ac . sg
