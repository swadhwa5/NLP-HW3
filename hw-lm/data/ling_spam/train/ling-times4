<subject> ipa vs americanist symbols </subject> i am at last drawn to reply to the debate on ipa versus ' americanist ' traditions in phonetic transcription . i was , frankly , somewhat surprised by the tone of the original submission , suggesting that the ipa 's refusal to use hachek / wedge symbols for palatoalveolars was an example of racism ( both anti - americanism and anti-slavicism , and no doubt anti - diacriticism ) . now we learn that the ipa itself is an anti-democratic conspiracy , and we need a new campaign led by american organisations to make phonetic transcription 's afe for democracy , apple pie , and the american way ' ! ? a couple of points need to made in this regard , i think . first , it is not true that the ipa is not used in north america . what we have here is maybe not euro - centrism , but phonology / dialectology centrism ! clinical phoneticians and speech pathologists in north american nearly always use the ipa ( yes : long esses / zees , jods , and the cardinal vowel system , and all ! ) indeed , some departments of linguistics / phonetics operate within the ipa tradition ( e . g . university of victoria bc ) . on the other hand , virtually all phonologists on this side of the atlantic use the so-called americanist symbols . the divide , therefore , is not as has been portrayed . if phonologists tend to use one set of symbols , and phoneticians another , is that really such a problem , as often they are concerned with different levels of description anyway ? even if phoneticians cannot agree , is this also such a problem ? can raising the fears of racial discrimination and undemocratic conspiracies really be justified over relatively trivial distinctions in symbols that anyone trained in the area knows about anyway ? the second point concerns the debate on the symbols themselves . as i have just noted , the difference between certain symbols is surely not a fundamentally important one ; but i would like to speak in defence of the ipa non-hachek versions . leaving aside the fact that these symbols do have a long history , i ( do ) feel that a unit symbol is preferably than a composite one . ( unlike the original posting , it always seemed obvious to me that the hachek symbols were s / z etc plus a diacritic ) . granted that the ipa is not always consistent on this point , a unitary symbol approach avoids confusions as to the nature of the s - s distinction . one may have to counter students ' feelings that [ s ] is really only a type of [ s ] which is reinforced by the spelling ; it does n't help if the symbol looks also like a 's ort of s ' . we might also look at the difference with [ j ] versus [ y ] for the palatal approximant . on the surface , this looks fine , as the [ y ] spelling is familiar ( but surely anglocentric , and not in line with slavic / germanic etc usage ? ) . however , this choice then leaves us with a problem for a high front rounded vowel . if we can't use [ y ] then we must resort to [ u " ] . the diacritic [ " ] , however , is also commonly used in many traditions to stand for centralized . this transcription also suggests that [ u " ] is a variety of [ u ] , and that [ o " ] is a variety of [ o ] etc . the use of independent symbols leaves open the relationship between lip-rounding and tongue position , which the 'd iaresis ' versions do not . however phonetic transcription develops in the future , let 's avoid throwing around accusations at other users or bodies . utopian schemes of universal orthodoxy in this area are surely unneccessary if not unsound . to be realistic , most ipa users ( wherever they ' re based ) are unlikely to surrender over a century 's worth of patterns of usage , and non - ipa users will be equally keen to keep to their symbolizations . let 's learn to live with this , and spend instead time on refining transcription systems ( e . g . for the transcription of atypical speech found in speech pathology clinics ) . perhaps , vive la difference is the motto to aspire to ! martin j . ball university of ulster
<subject> re : 6 . 199 ipa </subject> it would be nice to have true democracy when trying to reach agreement on how to use phonetic symbols , as stemburger has suggested . just as war is too important a matter to be left to the generals , so choosing a standardized set of symbols should n't be left to the phoneticians . the international phonetic association has always recognized this . it is fully conscious of the fact that ipa symbols are used by a wide variety of people . at the 1989 kiel convention , which was the first major revision for almost 50 years , there was a great deal of discussion about remembering our ' customers ' , as one phonetician put it . and ( despite comments to the contrary by participants in this discussion ) the only changes since then have been small changes that affect comparatively few users of the alphabet , largely because of the belief that it is important for the alphabet to remain as stable as possible . if stemburger would like to organize some kind of referendum , good luck to him . i note that he suggests the lsa as the appropriate body for the u . s . , although he also mentions ashla ( american speech hearing and language association ) as an interested group that has officially adopted the ipa . their membership is much larger than the lsa . the asa ( acoustical society of america ) is another group that has many members interested in phonetic symbols . the1989 ipa kiel convention was open to all , and did include members of all the organizations mentioned by stemburger , including lsa , ashla , asa , sil and others , none of the participants , of course , speaking officially for any of these organizations . the convention was also publicized in a paper in language , the only paper that morris halle and i have ever co-authored . i really do not see how we can get more international collaboration . agreeing on symbols is as difficult as getting everyone to use the same units for measuring weights and distances . in response to my previous suggestion that people interested in choices of phonetic symbols should join the international phonetic association , i have received inquiries as to how to do this . there is a form in the journal of the international phonetic association ( which members receive - - and your university library + should + take ) . but really all you need to do is to send your name and address , plus a check for $ 25 or # 13 sterling ( or request to charge access / mastercharge / visa / eurocard ) for the annual dues to : secretariat , ipa linguistics and phonetics univeristy of leeds leeds , ls2 9jt , u . k . peter ladefoged

<subject> latvian language policy </subject> i have found the topic of " linguistic human rights violations " particularly interesting , but i am a little confused as to what constitutes such a violation . marc picard writes , " personally , i would hope that latvians would take any measures they deem necessary to get everybody in their country to speak their language . " if someone were to issue such a statement about the language situation in the united states ( particularly with regards to native speakers of spanish who are residents / citizens of the us ) , i am sure that some group would throw up its arms in protest of the oppression of this segment of the population . is this what is meant by a " linguistic human rights violation " ? is it something more severe ? or are we looking at other countries and applying different standards than those which we apply in the united states ? mark mitton carleton college northfield , mn 55057 mittonm @ carleton . edu

<subject> dick armey 's slip and correction </subject> i was curious if anyone was actually interested in verifying whether armey 's slip was actually a slip . but since someone has asked what the time delay between the utterance of " barney fag " and his correction : having heard a replay , i would say the delay was less than a second . imo , the utterance was definitely a slip and not a slur . other factors would support this conclusion , apart from the delay , phonology , etc . , primary among them the fact that armey is n't stupid . he 's a ph . d . in economics , and has the political savvy to get himself elected majority whip . only the politically ( or linguistically ) tendentious would be likely to assert that someone of his political skills would think it to his advantage to make such an utterance . what a shame it was to see members of this list anxious to use their professional skills ( or to abuse them ) in order to make a political point . two weeks into this discussion and only now does anyone actually inquire into the data . it makes one wonder how much linguistic research is driven by other agendas , and what the quality of that research is . . . dave wharton

<subject> referencing example numbers in wp </subject> since the question has been raised about how to reference example numbers in wordperfect for dos , here 's my two-cents ' worth about wp5 . 1 and wp6 for dos . in 5 . 1 , although one could use paragraph numbers , as was suggested , this precludes using them to number sections of a paper . a better approach is to use the numbering facilities for " graphics boxes . " like paragraph numbers , graphics boxes can be referenced by the cross-reference feature in wp . what you have to do is set equation box options so that the caption is to the left of the box ( the default is to the right ) . for phonological rules , which can be nicely formatted using the equation editor , you then create an equation box with a caption consisting of " ( [ box number ] ) " and go into the equation editor to write the rule . for sample sentences , etc . , the box itself is empty , but with a caption as before , and set to allow text to overlap it . you can then exit the create graphics box screen and proceed to type the examples . the numbers automatically update as new boxes are added . cross - referencing is done by assigning name to any example you want to reference ( as a cross-reference target ) and then putting in a cross-reference reference code with the target 's name . you have to generate occasionally to update the reference numbers ; they initially appear as ? . in wp6 ( which is superior for linguistics because of its support for phonetic symbols ) it 's even easier . wp6 has a counters feature ( in the character format dialog box ) . you define a counter ( i call mine example ) . whenever you want to insert an example , you type ( in the main document screen ) the open parenthesis , go into the counters dialog box , and push f8 ( or click on the increment and display button ) . this inserts two codes : one to increment the number ( this is not done automatically for user-defined counters ) and one to display it . cross - referencing is done as before . a couple of additional wp tips : - the styles feature is very useful for dealing with in-text stylesheets for journals . for any feature where journals have different styles ( scare quotes , sentence glosses and translations , in-text reference punctuation , etc . ) you assign a style . styles can be any combination of characters and codes . for each journal , you create a different style library . then , if you want to change formatting from one to another , you simply read in a different style library . - the above is too simple for bibliography style sheets , where the order of elements differs in addition to punctuation and font attribute . if you are comfortable with programming , you can write merge programs ( called primary merge files in wp5 . 1 and merge form files in wp6 ) for the different stylesheets and have a bibliography file which is formatted as a secondary merge file ( wp5 . 1 ) / merge data file ( wp6 ) , with fields for things like author 's first and last names , year , title , etc . ( include a field for type of reference ( book , article , dissertation , etc . ) since the format of the title may vary . ) this is not recommended for computerphobes , however . - lining up foreign language examples with word-for - word glosses in proportional fonts can be done using tabs , and resetting the tab stops for each example . this is easier from wp6 . 0b onwards ( if you have a mouse ) because of the ruler feature : you display the ruler and drag the tab stops , and as you drag them a dotted line extends down from the tab stop through the text so you can see exactly where you are . in previous versions , you have to go into the tab set menu and play with the tab settings by trial and error . it is even possible to put asterisks inside the space of the tab between the example number and the example . instead of tabbing , use the tab align ( wp5 . 1 ) or decimal align ( wp6 ) feature ( ctrl f6 ) . before pressing ctrl - f6 , set the " decimal character " to the first letter of the example ( on the other format menu in 5 . 1 and the character format menu in 6 ) . to prevent the spell-checker from stopping on words in foreign examples ( or phonetic representations , or logical formulae ) , in 5 . 1 you can use the language feature to insert a made-up language code . the spell-checker will complain that it can't find the dictionary for the language , and you tell it to ignore the language and continue checking what it can . in wp6 a block can be marked [ speller / grammatik off ] ( on the other format menu ) to prevent it from being spell - or grammar-checked . - - yehuda n . falk department of english the hebrew university of jerusalem " live long and prosper " - vulcan greeting
<subject> summary : c - insertion </subject> some weeks ago i posted a query as to whether anyone knew examples of consonant insertion to separate impermissible vowel clusters , in which the choice of consonant was not conditioned by its surrounding vowels . thanks who all those who responded . their names and e-mail addresses appear with their edited remarks . i would welcome further comments on anything brought up in this summary . reason for the query : my query was prompted by work i ' ve been doing on the czech verb system in which , in certain forms from certain paradigms , a glide / j / appears that is not present in other forms . ( since most e-mail won't support czech diacritics , i ' ll spell all czech forms phonetically . an apostrophe after a consonant indicates its palatalization . ) typical of such verbs is the verb [ d ' elat ] " to do " : [ d ' ela : ] " he / she / it does " [ d ' elaji : ] " they do " [ d ' elaji : c ] active participle ( plural ) in old church slavonic and in russian , this / j / appears in all persons of the present tense in related paradigms ( e . g . , russian [ d ' elajet ] " to do " 3rd per . sing . ) and creates a vjv sequence , which historically contracted into a long vowel in czech ( e . g . , [ d ' ela : ] ) . in most current phonological accounts of west slavic languages , such as rubach ( 1993 ) , this / j / is considered to be present underlyingly , but then needs to be deleted in almost all forms of these verbs . this representation seemed too abstract to me , and when i considered czech phonotactic restrictions ( see charts in palkova ( 1994 ) ) from an autosegmental viewpoint , it occurred to me that the / j / ( where it does survive ) may simply be inserted to break up impermissible v clusters or to prevent formation of overlong syllable nuclei . the only sticking point in this was that / j / often appears between non-high vs or vs with which it shares no obvious features . as i found out from the responses and from searching i ' ve done since , the epenthesis of consonants between non-homorganic vowels is not as uncommon as one might assume . so far , the norm seems to be that cs inserted at morpheme boundaries will be glides ( even between non-high vs ) unless there is a relic consonant that has been retained , and sometimes analogically extended , in a given environment . in all cases i ' ve found where the inserted c is a relic , that c is coronal . more data would be greatly welcome . the responses : albert ortmann ( ortmann @ sapir . ling . uni-duesseldorf . de ) mentioned several examples : english intrusive / r / , french t-epenthesis in interrogative forms , dutch insertion of / j / and / v / between non-high vs morpheme internally ( e . g . , theater [ te : ' ( j ) a : t @ r ] ; zovals [ zo : ' ( v ) als ] " like , as if " ) , and swiss german insertion of / n / between certain hosts and clitics ( e . g . groesser wie-n - i " taller than - ep - i " ) . = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = subj : vowel clusters from : spscob @ main . queen-margaret - college . ac . uk from : spscob @ main . queen-margaret - college . ac . uk x - from : spscob @ main . queen-margaret - college . ac . uk ( dr james m scobbie ) some people might think that / r / sandhi in english is of the type you are looking for , but really / r / is just the consonantal glide counterpart of non-high vowels , so it 's just like finding / j / near / i / or / w / near / u / . note , however , that to avoid inserting / r / in certain socially stigmatised environments , many speakers insert glottal stop : law [ ? ] and order instead of law [ r ] and order = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = subj : c - insertion from : seegmiller @ apollo . montclair . edu ( steve seegmiller ) karachay , a turkic language , has a clear case of a consonant appearing under certain circumstances involving what would otherwise be v - v sequences . the plural suffix is - le or - la ( depending on vowel harmony ) , so that at ' horse ' has the plural atla . however , if the plural suffix is itself followed by another suffix beginning with a vowel , an - r - appears : atlari " m ' my horses ' .

if the final syllable of the stem is heavy ( that is , if it ends with a long vowel or a diphthong ) , then - aa is suffixed , an epenthetic [ w ] being added . the infinitives ashakataa / a = shaka-ta - aa / ( 0 = get . off - tt-inf ) " to get off " y cheecheewaa / cheechee-aa / ( soft - inf ) " to be soft " illustrate this contrast . = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = thanks again to all who responded . i 'd welcome more examples if anyone knows of any . james kirchner jpkirchner @ aol . com
<subject> re : 6 . 249 dick armey 's slip and correction </subject> i ' m sorry if this was in the original post , but it seems obvious to me that phonological misprocessing is not the only possible type of " slip " we could be dealing with , indeed , i do n't know the " speech error " literature all that well but " fak " for " frank " seems totally out as a likely error , in my view ( has anyone looked at the phonological context ? ) . surely the suspicion must be that this is a privately used slur of representative frank that crept into public discourse - - i . e . , it was a register problem rather than a phonological one . it would seem unfortunate ( just to respond to the " political agenda " part of an earlier post ) if we as linguists refused to bring our competence to bear on questions such as this for fear of being " politicized " . mark
<subject> re : 6 . 249 dick armey 's slip and correction </subject> could someone provide the context for dick armey 's utterance of " barney fag " ? i only heard it once and did n't write it down . my impression at the time , however , was that the phonological environment did n't seem quite right for a spoonerism . one other thought : it seems that a binary opposition between an intentional slur on armey 's part and a purely phonological slip does n't represent all the possibilities . it 's certainly possible that if the string " barney fag " has been used often enough on capitol hill in the hearing of dick armey , he might very well have inadvertently substituted it for frank 's actual name . is n't that something that 's done all the time : accidentally saying something that one has heard recently or repeatedly . " can't get that tune out of my head ! " seems like a reasonable explanation for a " slip " that was n't a spoonerism . anything on non-spoonerism phonological slips out there that bears on this ? phil gaines
<subject> dick armey 's slip </subject> so dave wharton , having determined that the delay between richard armey 's " barney fag " remark and its correction lasted less than a second , is confident that it must have been " a slip and not a slur " ( presumably blameless ) , all the more since armey has a ph . d . and a wealth of political savvy and " would not think it to his advantage to make such an utterance . " a victim , then , of linguists with ulterior agendas . how in the in the world is one to respond to such a statement ? if wharton had made the suggestion 75 years ago you might repeat the observation that freud offered in the introductory lectures to the effect that the merely somatic or phonetic concommitents of slips can't explain why they occur when they do - - as he put it , it 's like telling a policeman that the darkness of the night and the isolation of the street have caused your purse to be snatched . what might have possessed armey , then ? the new republic has pointed out that he was one of only forty-seven members ( gingrich was not among them ) who voted against george bush 's hate crime statistics act , which allowed the government to record violence against homosexuals ; that he voted to exclude people with aids from the americans with disabilities act ; that he voted to deny government funds to groups that boycotted the boy scouts of america on the grounds of that organization 's anti-gay policies ; and that he refused to sign a voluntary statement saying that his own office did n't discriminate against homosexuals . of course the remark was n't " intentional , " but the evidence is pretty thick that armey harbors just the sorts of inner demons who would have been lying in wait for any breach in conscious attention . most inhabitants of the late 20th century will acknowlege some acquaintance with pesky creatures like these , and you would think that it would be only by an act of willful repression that someone could deny their existence entirely . but maybe we should give wharton the benefit of the doubt ; maybe his is a genuine victorian innocence . only , just think of it ! all those theorists arguing that we are living the twilight of modernist era , when there are still people ( with an " edu " in their address , yet ) on whom it has not even begun to dawn .
<subject> re : 6 . 249 dick armey 's slip and correction </subject> having read all of the research literature on slips of the tongue and having scanned them in both normal and aphasic corpora , i find it hard to believe that this much discussed slip was linguistic tho it may , in some sense , have been freudian . bob wachal
<subject> re : 6 . 249 dick armey 's slip and correction </subject> slurs . . . i mean , sirs : armey 's slip could very well have been a slip , but a slip of this sort represents a competing plan , and one can then ask , why the competing plan ? phonological similarity ( " similarity " being the aristotean catch-all ) [ / fraenk / vs . / faeg / ] or something more like bernie baars 's " unintentional " pun , clearly indicating something a bit more than raw phonological similarity . the non-phonological , competing plan notion brings up all sorts of interpretive issues concerning why armey may or may not have had something painfully abusive " on his mind " when he produced " fag . " if it had been " on his mind , " it was ( at that point in time during on-line speech ) not anything typically volitional and intentional . these are tricky issues .

) - does the signer get the audiences attention ? ) - is the story well structured ? ) - is the story within the time limits set ( usually 3 minutes ) ? ) - does the signer keep to the rules ? ) this usually consists of - no dirty jokes . ) - no overzealous religious contexts . ) ) the competitior must give a title to his / her story and state its type , ( ie true ) story , joke story , sad story , not true story etc . . . ) ) ) if the story exceeds the time limit a point is deducted . however the signer is ) not interrupted if he / she exceeds the limit but is allowed to complete the ) story ( unless it really is too long ! ! ! ) . ) ) sometimes , at the end the winner ( if he / she is popular with the audience is ) asked to repeat it or give another story ) . ) ) . . . sign-singing is not too common among the deaf community far as i am ) aware . it is mostly done in religious situations . i think it is n't a strong ) component of deaf culture . however story-telling is a strong part of deaf ) culture and especially of making jokes and light-hearted teasing . anyway thats ) my deaf experience here in new zealand . ) from karina bingham ( karina @ uhunix . uhcc . hawaii . edu ) : ) there is an african - american a cappella group called " sweet honey in the ) rock " who have a full-time signer in the group . she performs with them and ) signs her interpretations of the songs . they recently published a book ) for their 25th anniversary : ) ) reagon , bernice johnson . the long journey home . 1994 . ) ) in which the signer discusses her experiences in the deaf community and ) a deaf church ( where the congregation sang in sign ) . her parents were both ) deaf ; she is not . ) from marina mcintire ( mmcintir @ lynx . dac . neu . edu ) : ) you have inadvertently touched upon a very tender issue in the deaf ) community here in the us . first , let me say that only in the us have i ) seen this phenomenon . brits ( both deaf and hearing who work with them ) ) are confounded and amused by it . in the us , it used to be quite the ) thing to translate songs and develop routines to go with them , produce ) recitals and concerts , and the like . it arose , most likely , out of a ) strong church-related tradition of " helpers " for deaf people . ) ) in the last ten to fifteen years , however , deaf people have begun their ) own liberation . song - signing has been a casualty , by and large . it is ) viewed as representing one aspect of a pathological or clinical view of ) deafness , i . e . , that the worst " loss " resulting from deafness is music . ) this is , of course , far from the truth . and for culturally deaf people , ) music is a peculiarity belonging to the mainstream hearing world and of ) no consequence in their lives whatsoever . so * that * motive ( helping ) d / deaf people appreciate what they ' re missing ) is not acceptable . ) ) another complaint is that , by and large , translations are more ) influenced by the rhythm of the music than by any sense it might make in ) asl , presenting d / deaf audiences with nonsensical or distorted versions ) of signs and signed syntax . this arises partly , of course , out of the ) difficulty of translating any poetry into any language . ) ) worst of all , and perhaps most puzzling to d / deaf people , is the ) insistence of most song-signers on including things like " tra la la " or ) humming . there is * nothing * that could make less sense to a d / deaf ) audience ! ) ) i will say that i have seen some wonderful song-sign translations done , ) including some with rather elegant dance routines . sometimes these have ) been done by d / deaf people and sometimes by hearing folks . by and large , ) however , this practice is no longer an acceptable pasttime in our ) community . exceptions are made , ironically , for interpreters who work in ) theater . musical productions , because of their general inclusion of ) dance ( a more interesting visual event ) and costume / props / etc . . . are ) quite popular and well-attended ( comparatively speaking ) by d / deaf ) theatre-goers . many thanks to all those who replied . randy lapolla institute of history and philology academia sinica
<subject> dependency grammar : corrections , reactions , reformatting </subject> apparently i made a few mistakes in the posting about my manuscript on dependency grammar . this is curious , because i apparently got everything right on the earlier posting on the same topic to the dg and hpsg lists . at least two people have informed me that they successfully ftp-ed everything , but at least two others have had problems . the address should be : julius . ling . ohio-state . edu the suffixes . ps . gz on the file-names ( not the address ) indicate that they are compressed , so you need to uncompress them using the command ' gunzip ' . the slashes in the directory address should be ' / ' and not ' \ ' . presumably because of some sort of software error , i cannot read things in my inbox . but i put three of the reactions to my previous posting there before i had grown accustomed to this problem , so i cannot answer these directly , but will now try to do so through the linguist list . to the respondent from finland : you wanted a numerical address . it is : 128 . 146 . 172 . 200 to the respondent from taiwan ( or was it hongkong ? ) . you noted a problem with chapter 7 . the general problem has now been corrected , but there may still be a problem with one or two of the examples . if so , i can send an ascii file , as you suggested , or a paper copy of these examples , if you send me a regular mail address , but in either case you have to write to me again . i am now used to reading my mail and replying if necessary , or at least writing down the essential information , before downloading . nevertheless , i hope the compuserve people solve the problem soon . to the " computer illiterate / dyslexic " ( your own term ) : surely you can find someone there who is able to help you with the ftp procedure . the university you are at must have more than its share of experts in this area . but i can also send you an ascii version of chapter 1 via email , if you write to me again . for the sake of making my files more compatible with the software linguists most often use , andreas kathol has advised me to reformat my manuscript in latex . unfortunately , he does n't know where to get a latex software packet for use with pcs ( what i use ) . can anyone help by giving me a site to ftp from ? i am in the process of creating a latex version of the files . dan maxwell 100101 , 2276 @ compuserve . com

<subject> sum : verbal / pronominal feature differences </subject> earlier this month i posted the following query : = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = what languages ( if any ) do people know about , where there are distinctions carried in the verbal morphology which cannot be indicated in the pronominal system ? ( for example , if a language expressed gender differences in the verbs , but not in pronouns ) . = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = the following people very kindly replied with various pieces of very useful information : antton elosegi aldasoro ( fvpelala @ sd . ehu . es ) ariel mira ( mariel @ ccsg . tau . ac . il ) " ellen l . contini - morava " ( elc9j @ faraday . clas . virginia . edu ) simon corston ( corston @ humanitas . ucsb . edu ) brian d joseph ( bjoseph @ magnus . acs . ohio-state . edu ) june wickboldt : jwickbol @ ucs . indiana . edu here are the replies : the two most promising examples of what i was asking about come from basque and hebrew , where the pronominal and verbal systems do not match for gender : - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - antton elosegi aldasoro ( fvpelala @ sd . ehu . es ) in basque there is not gender at all in nouns or pronouns , but some verbal forms carry the distinction of the gender of the 2nd person nik ekarri diat nik ekarri dinat i ( erg ) give it to you-masc i ( erg ) give it to you-fem antton elosegi ( university of the basque country ) ariel mira ( mariel @ ccsg . tau . ac . il ) in my own hebrew " normal " verbal inflections ( past and future ) distinguish person gender and number in 2nd and 3rd persons , but only number in 1st person . so far so good , because so does the free pronominal system . however , our now present tense is morphologically a nominal form ( for eg . holexet = ' walk ( fem ) ' as well as ' walker ( fem ) ' . now , our nominal forms , having nothing to do with pronominal forms inflects for number and gender , but does not distinguish persons . the result is that now 1st person present inflection distinguishes between fem and masc though the independent pronoun does not . modern hebrew is losing some gender distinctions too ! 1 . future tense 3rd pers plural : fem form is hardly ever used . even the purist language academy has " abolished " the form . ( we do n't seem to ever have had it in past tense ) . 2 . in colloquial speech , the same is happening to 2nd person , no doubt because the 2nd and 3rd person plural fem forms are identical ( though not the masc ones they have converged with ) . 3 . this needs to be checked ! the free plural feminine pronoun , as well as past inflections of same seem to me to be shaking . but real data has to be recorded for this , so do n't make much of this . i wonder whether mixed forms are possible , namely , you-fem go + masc , etc . * and on a more theoretical note * : hopefully you will find very few examples for what you are looking , because i believe ( what others have been saying for about a hundred years ) that inflections tend to develop out of free pronouns . hence , the dependence between the meanings encoded , though there is no principled reason for the inflection to change later , i guess . it is really unlikely , though , because once the form is inflected , fused with the verb , chances are it won't develop its separate semantics . if you ' re interested in theories about the development of inflection out of pronouns , i have my own , which accounts for the well-known fact that inflections for 1st and 2nd person are much more prevalent than 3rd person . i claim this is so not because 3rd person is unmarked , but rather , since referents of 3rd person are usually much less accessible than referents of 1st and 2nd person ( the speaker and the addressee ) . minimal forms are reserved for more accessible referents ( in general ) , hence inflections are the natural development out of free pronouns for highly accessible antecedents . you can have a look at my book ' accessing np antecedents ' , routledge , 1990 , chapter 6 . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - the following two respondents quote cases where logophoric and obviative marking occur attached to the verb rather than to the pronoun to which they refer . to me , it seems that these particles are not inflections as such , though i am not sure exactly how i would classify them . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - june wickboldt : jwickbol @ ucs . indiana . edu some languages having logophoric reference mark the reference with verbal affixes , not pronouns or pronominals . two are newari , see karen ebert . 1986 . reported speech in some languages of nepal . in f . coulmas ( ed . ) direct and indirect speech , berlin : mouton de gruyter , and gokana , see hyman , larry m . and bernard comrie . 1981 . logophoric reference in gokana . journal of african languages and linguistics . 3 : 19-37 . brian d joseph ( bjoseph @ magnus . acs . ohio-state . edu ) the algonquian language cree , spoken in canada , has a category known in the literature as " obviative " , which provides a way of distinguishing between different third-persons in a discourse ( the first one mentioned is " proximate " , and the next one mentioned is " obviative " , so cree can distinguish unambiguously between " john met bill as he was walking down the street " where rhe " in english can refer to either john or bill - - in cree it would be unambiguously one or the other ) . for the most part , and this is where it is relevant to you , this marking shows up on the verb ( thus the verb form in the above sentence would be different if it was john walking or bill walking ) ; nouns can show obviative / proximate marking ( though one class , the so-called " inanimate " nouns do not ) , and there are proximate and obviative forms of demonstrative pronouns , but not of the personal pronouns . thus " wi : ya " is ' he / proximate ' as well as ' he / obviative ' . pronouns are not usually expressed in cree , but if you just look at the personal pronouns , then cree would be a language of the sort you were looking for . for that matter , these facts are similar in virtually all the algonquian languages , so it is n't just cree . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - finally , two respondents noted that independent pronouns are not necessarily marked for case in the same way as pronominal affixes . such phenomena do not seem rare to me ( e . g . arabic does the same ) . i am assuming then that such cases are not marked . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - " ellen l . contini - morava " ( elc9j @ faraday . clas . virginia . edu ) in swahili part of the verb morphology is subject and object prefixes , that signal info . about participant role with respect to the action of the verb . this distinction is not made among independent pronouns , which distinguish only person and number . but since the subject and object prefixes in swahili are often called " pronominal " , i do n't know if this counts as a distinction that can't be made by pronouns . simon corston ( corston @ humanitas . ucsb . edu ) in my ma , in press in the pacific linguistics series from anu , i discuss ' ergativity in roviana ' . roviana has special pronominal forms used for absolutive ( s ( 's ubject of intr ' ) or o ( ' object ' ) ) , and different forms for a ( 's ubject of tr ' ) . the pronouns make distinctions in person , number , and incl / ecl for 1pl . there are pronominal verbal affixes on the verb which are always only o . i . e . whereas the independent prons do n't distinguish s / o , the pronominal affixes do . somewhere around here i have a brief sketch of roviana which i have been sending to people . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - i found everything very interesting , and am happy to receive any more info on my query above . thanks again to those who responded ! maik gibson university of reading

<subject> addendum to coston 's object affixes </subject> in his summary of object affixes ( linguist list : vol-6 - 235 . fri 17 feb 1995 ) , simon corston observes : languages with object affixes but which lack affixes indicating other grammatical relations do occur , but would appear to be uncommon . that , however , really depends on what we mean by object affixes ( and subject affixes for that matter ) . so - called subject and object affixes fall into three types : ( i ) nonreferential / nonanaphoric agreement markers ; ( ii ) ' functionally ambiguous ' agreement markers ( i . e . functioning as both nonreferential / nonanaphoric agreement markers and anaphoric / referential markers depending on the context ) ( bresnan and mchombo 1987 ) ; and ( iii ) anaphoric or referential markers . the nuclear micronesian group provides an interesting case for the foregoing distinction . for instance , in woleaian , the subject markers are independent words , whereas the object markers are suffixes . but they are both functionally ambiguous agreement markers . in kusaiean , the subject and object markers are also independent words and suffixes , respectively . but they are all referential pronouns . for more detailed discussion of the nuclear micronesian languages see my paper : ' the verb - object bonding principle : with special reference to nuclear micronesian languages ' ( see refs below ) . if the complexity in subject and object affixes ( viz . the three types mentioned above ) is disregarded , probably corston 's observation may hold . but if only anaphoric / referential subject and object markers are taken into account , it may be a different story . in fact , in the same paper i have used a small convenience sample of 40 languages to ascertain whether the verb - object bonding principle ( as proposed in tomlin 1986 : ' a transitive verb and its object form a more cohesive , unified syntactic and semantic whole than do a transitive verb and its subject ' ) is evident in the pronominal system as well : e . g . object pronouns are more tightly bonded to the verb than subject pronouns are . the upshot of this investigation is that object pronouns ( e . g . affixes ) are more tightly bonded to the verb than subject pronouns ( e . g . independent words ) . this suggests that insofar as referential / anaphoric markers are concerned , ' languages with object affixes but which lack affixes indicating other grammatical relations ' may be crosslinguistically common , rather than uncommon . refereneces bresnan j . and s . mchombo 1987 . topic , pronoun , and agreement in chichewa . language 63 : 741-782 . givon , t . 1976 . topic , pronoun , and grammatical agreement . in subject and topic , ed . by c . n . li , pp . 149-188 . new york : academic press . tomlin , r . s . 1986 . basic word order : functional principles . london : croom helm . song , j . j . 1994 . the verb - object bonding principle : with special reference to nuclear micronesian languages . oceanic linguistics 33 . 2 ( in press ) . jae jung song university of otago new zealand
<subject> asl dictionary on cd-rom </subject> my recent query concerning the new american sign language ( asl ) dictionary on cd-rom generated a substantial response , both from this list and from slling - l . i have summarized the main points of these responses below . please bear in mind that i have not seen the products in question . the dictionary reviewed on pbs is the american sign language dictionary on cd-rom by martin sternberg and is distributed by harpercollins . the following is the positive point that recurs in people 's messages : - - it is at the moment the only published asl dictionary that includes motion videos of asl signs , which serves to disambiguate unclarities in printed representations . the following are the negative points that recur in people 's messages : - - the dictionary is based too heavily on english , being essentially an english - to - asl dictionary . this both makes it hard ( at times , impossible ) to get an idea of the internal structure of the asl lexicon , and makes it less useful to native signers . ( there is , however , some categorization into semantic groups . ) there are also more specific problems arising from the failure to make asl distinctions that are not made overtly in english ( e . g . english " lecture " is used as a headword , while the asl equivalent is specifically a verb , not a noun ; classifiers are almost completely omitted ) . - - the dictionary is based on sternberg 's book-form dictionary of the early 1980s , and fails to take account of recent developments in the study of asl . - - there may be technical quality concerns , but since i have n't seen the product i ' m not in a position to judge . it seems to work better on more modern machines , and the mac version seems to work better than the windows version . alternatives : the following other cd-rom asl dictionary projects were drawn to my attention : - - multemedia dictionary of asl ( mm-dasl ) , release planned for summer of 1995 . this dictionary is based generally on the work of william stokoe ( who is involved in the project ) . it allows direct lookup of asl signs , incorporates recent linguistic work on asl , and is assisted by a panel of native asl users . for details , please contact sherman wilcox , university of new mexico ( wilcox @ mail . unm . edu ) . - - asl dictionary on cd-rom developed by dennis cokely at linstok press , 4020 blackburn lane , burtonsville , md 20866 , and alpha and beta tested by ken rust at madonna university , who should be contacted for further details ( rust @ smpt . munet . edu ) . thanks to : jacqueline anderson , nancy frishberg , marian macchi , mark a . mandell , joyce mcdonough , chris miller , karen mistry , becky moreton , cindy neuroth - gimbrone , steve seegmiller , mark seidenberg , barbara sensiba , dan slobin , leslie h . stennes , sherman wilcox , and the authors of the many messages that were forwarded to me from slling - l . - - bernard comrie dept of linguistics gfs-301 tel + 1 213 740 2986 university of southern california fax + 1 213 740 9306 los angeles , ca 90089-1693 , usa e-mail comrie @ bcf . usc . edu
<subject> query on physical appearance of words </subject> content - length : 1535 we are a group of environmental scientists who have been pondering a question . has anyone done research on emotional responses to the * physical appearance * of words or groups of letters ? for example , ' toxic ' , 'd ioxin ' or the ' oxi ' combination . why do people have a fear of 'd ioxin ' but not ' furan ' ( another toxic chemical ) . obviously , some reaction is created by the media , but is there something else involved ? do certain combinations of letters ( e . g .

<subject> interim summary : anthropoid linguistic ability </subject> in linguist 5-1467 ( 18 dec . 1994 ) , i posted the following query : ) douglas h . chadwick , in his review of kanzi : the ape at the brink of the ) human mind , by sue savage - rumbaugh and roger lewin ( nytimes book review , ) dec . 11 , 1994 , pp . 15-19 ) , says , ) ) ) . . . this goes a long way toward countering the complaint that language - ) ) using apes are merely responding to cues from researchers or , at best , ) ) learning rote behavior to get rewards without really comprehending the ) ) meaning of the words they employ . . . . part of the problem is that the ) ) authors are playing by rules laid down by their critics . it was rene ) ) descartes . . . who fashioned the longstanding paradigm of animals as ) ) automatons [ sic ] , incapable of doing anything other than mindlessly ) ) responding to whatever forces impinge on them . descartes insisted that ) ) animals cannot even feel real pain or pleasure , much less understand or ) ) remember the experience . . . . in our era , this tradition has been carried ) ) on by linguistics experts equally intent on preserving language and rea - ) ) son for the exclusive use of humans . each time an ape demonstrates ei - ) ) ther ability , the linguists set about redefining language and reason in ) ) more complex and confusing ways , erecting yet more artificial barriers ) ) for primates to hurdle . ) ) excuse me , is this something i ' ve missed in my seven years of grad school ) and subsequent four years of professional activity in linguistics ? are ) we deliberately engaged in a dastardly plot to deny our anthropoid cou - ) sins their birthright ? psycholinguistics has never been one of my fortes , ) but i certainly do n't remember anything in the introductory survey cour - ) ses i ' ve taken myself or developed to teach to others anything so much as ) hinting that it is an a priori assumption of the field of linguistics ) that language is the exclusive prerogative of homo sapiens , only that ) it 's an important part of the package that defines that species . ) ) i remember enthusiastically inflated claims made back in the 50 's about ) the forseeable progress in computer technology - - predictions as to how ) quickly we would get computers that could not only converse with us in ) real time in some given human language ( default : english ) but whop any ) human being in chess as well . as all ai researchers know , it soon became ) clear that these predictions were based in part on an oversimplified ) notion of what constituted language ( if i remember correctly , some ) premises were on the level of edgar rice - burroughs ' endowing his heroes ) with a 's pectacular ability to master alien languages ' that consisted of ) an ability to memorize a dictionary ) . and i understand that many claims ) about ' ape language ' , and the rebuttals from the community of linguists , ) have been at similar levels . but it seems to me that this is quite ) different from the scenario in which the academic linguist , threatened by ) the physical anthropologist , mutters , ' hmm ; so far we ' ve felt safe with ) this definition of linguistic competence , but this chimp has mastered ) that . we ' ll have to change the definition if we want to avoid miscege - ) nation ! ' , which is apparently what chadwick is envisioning . ) ) now , i daresay there may be individual linguists who do react this way , ) just as in previous eras there were scientists who would from time to ) time redefine the standards of what constituted full humanity . or civi - ) lization , or what have you , to maintain the claim that whatever it was , ) the native peoples of africa and the western hemisphere did n't have it . ) but i certainly do n't , and i ' m not aware of any of my colleagues that ) do insist , as the sectional headline in the nyt book review has it , ' on ) keeping language and reason for humans alone ' ( i ' m also a little be - ) mused at this conflation of language and reason ; language has never ) struck me as an entirely ' rational ' process ) , much less that , as chadwick ) and , by derivation , said headline imply , that as a professional class we ) are unanimous in doing so . ) ) i ' m considering writing a letter to the editor to complain about this ; if ) anybody else has already done so , please let me know . but what i really ) want to know is , what is the current general consensus ( if there is one ) of ) the field on this subject ? are the claims in the savage - rumbaugh & lewin ) book anent kanzi 's linguistic ability valid ? or is some further clari - ) fication in order ? is it just that some researchers in this area have ) a ( perhaps understandable ) chip on their shoulder ? or is there a real ) conflict between theoretical linguists on the one hand and physical an - ) thropologists and primatologists on the other on this subject ? first of all , david pesetsky did write a letter to the new york times , which was published in the dec . 25 issue of the times book review , and i refer all interested parties to it ( for some reason , i can't find my copy at the moment ) . secondly , i 'd like to thank the following scholars who got in touch with me over the holidays to discuss this issue , discussion to be summarized below : john h . chalmers ( non12 @ cyber . net ) dick hudson ( uclrah @ ucl . ac . uk ) massimo piattelli - palmarini ( piattem @ dipsco . hsr . it ) tom j . pulju ( pulju @ ricevm1 . rice . edu ) harold schiffman ( haroldfs @ u . washington . edu ) discussion proceeded along two logically distinct questions : ( 1 ) what is currently the most accurate assessment of the ' linguistic performance ' , ( and , by inference , linguistic ability ) of the anthropoids ? ( 2 ) why are such people as the gardners , savage - rumbaugh , chadwick , etc . so irritated at us ? on the first question , all of my respondents , as well as david pesetsky , seem to be agreed that the most impressive ' linguistic ' performance of chimps and gorillas reported in the literature is at a level roughly equi - valent to that of a human child of approximately two years of age , but that the anthropoids seem to be unable to develop beyond that stage . in particular , they show no evidence for syntactic structure , nor for any ability to distance themselves temporally or spatially from the referents of their statements . i received statements such as the following : ' the most successful of the apes have managed to reach more or less the level of children in the two-word utterance stage . the size of the lexi - con is about the same , as is the combinatory ability . ' ' the apes master a refined system of communication , and are capable of some abstract thinking , but lack the very fundamentals of human language ( recursiveness , structure-dependency , parsing into constituents , etc . ) . ' ' the chimps mostly have a lexicon , and a rudimentary syntax that lets them distinguish between actor and patient , but that 's about all . . . . the chimps ( a ) have no morphology to speak of ( b ) can't use displacement of the message ( i . e . , can't talk about the past or future , or something that happens / ed in another location ) ' [ at a venture , i would guess that they can't handle contrafactuals either . ] ' it is claimed that the ape " utterances " lack grammaticality or syntax . the apes can make the correct symbolic associations , but have no sense of grammatical patterning . in two and three " word " sentences , the order of the elements is variable and each element maybe repeated any number of times in any order and independently of the rest ( sequences like give banana give kanzi kanzi banana kanzi give , etc . ) ' one of my respondents , partly on the basis of hanns own occasionally frus - trating experiences resulting from the geographical proximity of an insti - tution presumably devoted to the 's tudy ' of anthropoid language , made some critical statements about the scientific methodology of some of this research . in particular , after referring to hockett 's 16 'd esign fea - tures ' of language , hann remarks : ' the proponents ' claim that [ chimps ] do have cultural transmission , because washo taught her son , does n't bear up under much scrutiny ; washo had to be rewarded to learn every sign and her son has not learned as many , nor passed them on to any other chimp . i see what the chimps learned as the equivalent of a pidgin ; but creoliza - tion never took place . ' which implies ( 1 ) that anthropoid ' language ' ac - tually corresponds to the skinnerian model refuted by chomsky in his fa - mous review as regards human language and ( 2 ) that it is not sufficiently ' natural ' to the anthropoids for them to feel motivated to transmit it successfully . some of my respondents addressed some of the wider theoretical and metho - dological issues relevant to linguistics implicit in this discussion . one opined ' that some dismissal of ape language research is partly , and unconsciously , motivated by a turf-protection instinct . we ' re all alrea - dy uneasy about the fact that there are certain subfields of linguistics whose importance we acknowledge but which we ' re not personally terribly well-versed in . . . . i think many theoretical linguists breathed a sigh of relief when terrace announced that [ the chimp ] nim had n't really learned human language at all . it meant that they did n't have to worry about mo - difying their theories to fit ape language data . ' another said , ' most linguists do n't really care ( at least not consciously ) about whether apes can learn language as such , but they do care deeply about whether lan - guage is " sui generis " and innate or not . . . . as far as linguists are concerned , we ' re divided over chomsky 's claim that language is a geneti - cally-programmed module , rather than an area of knowledge which is han - dled by general cognition . if apes can't learn language at all , that supports the chomskyan view ( which presumably involves some cataclysmic mutation say 100 , 000 years ago , or at least since we split off from the other primates ) . if they can learn some of it , we have evidence for ge - neral cognition ( where apes are presumably less well endowed than us , so you 'd expect partial success ) . ' in further discussion we agreed that this argument only held if we accept a 's trong ' version of the relevant dichotomy implicit in the innateness hypothesis , according to which human linguistic ability is overwhelmingly if not completely independent of general human cognition . i pointed out that even if chimps are demonstrably distinct from us on a genetic level they still share over 98 % of our dna . so even if they share some of our linguistic ability it might mean that they also share some of the distinc - tive genetic endowment that provides it . a more effective test would be on cetaceans or pachyderms , which are nowhere as nearly related to us as chimps are but which appear to have roughly comparable cognitive levels . if they also share a certain amount of our linguistic ability , that would indicate that at least that amount is probably dependent more on general cognitive ability than on any specific genetic endowment . if chimps , dolphins , elephants , whatever , can't master human language but have other modes of communication * not isomorphic * with ours but of * comparable com - plexity and flexibility * , then this would give us the opportunity to stu - dy how much of human language is necessary to the general phenomenon of language and how much is incidental and of relevance only to our species ; it might also enable us to talk about the ' innateness ' of human linguistic ability in terms that would not be offputting to geneticists . on the second question , the basis for the irritation towards academic lin - guists on the part of the proponents of anthropoid language , there was some consensus that they were working with an overly simplistic concep - tion of what constitutes language , and were offended that we refused to share it . typical were the following remarks : ' all the [ proponents ] of animal language , and of its continuity with hu - man language , assume that human natural languages simply * are * the result of communication and use . . . . the basic design of human languages is * not * dictated by use , and we can easily conceive of species that would possess a * radically * different design for language and would communicate just as well , if not better . ' ' the gardners et al . have an extremely elementary grasp of what is real language . they think that if they have a lexicon and bare syntax , that 's all there is . their other argument , that the apes have " real " sign lan - guage , is also pitiful . . . . the approach trivializes both oral languages and sign languages . ' there was , however , some acknowledgment that some of the ' blame ' for this state of affairs belongs on our doorstep . the ' trivialization ' just men - tioned was claimed to be due at least in part to inadequacies in state - ments by linguists in the 50 's and 60 's . one respondent in particular pointed to an inveterate tendency to try to identify a single , defining , characteristic as the sine qua non of human linguistic ability , rather than accepting the fact that such important distinctions are often proper - ly made on the basis of mosaics of characteristics . in particular , much research in anthropoid ' language ' has apparently focussed on the ability of chimps and gorillas to coin novel expressions , unanticipated by their human teachers / handlers , on the basis of a finite number of memorized ' lexemes ' and some basic combinatorial principles . this effort has suppo - sedly been motivated by early assertions by academic linguists that what distinguishes human language from all other forms of animal communication is its creative ability . when the gardners , etc . , demonstrate that their apes are capable of similar creativity and we then say , ' very nice but that 's not language ' , they are understandably miffed . in response to this , i think what is necessary is greater tact , humility , and honesty on all our parts . we need to admit up front that we ( or our predecessors ) have oversimplified in the past , and give credit to the ape researchers for helping to elucidate the issues . and we need to make it clear that what chimps , gorillas , and two-year - old humans share is in some sense a * rudimentary * linguistic ability , but not equivalent to what adult humans do . in short , we need to increase everybody 's awareness of the inherent rich - ness and complexity of human linguistic behaviour , which to my mind means we need to devote more time and energy to introductory courses in general linguistics ! harold schiffman reports some encouraging success in this direction with a course on linguistic anthropology at the university of washington . further discussion on the issues raised here is welcome , either in perso - nal communication with me or in general discussion on the list . i hope in the not too distant to be able to post a short list of references to published literature on this subject . best , steven - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - dr . steven schaufele 712 west washington urbana , il 61801 217-344 - 8240 fcosws @ prairienet . org * * * * o syntagmata linguarum liberemini humanarum ! * * * * * * nihil vestris privari nisi obicibus potestis ! * * *
<subject> summary : " grasshopper mind " </subject> short answer : " grasshopper mind " is british english , not japanese - english . summary answer : thanks to those linguist readers who responded to my query ( 5 . 1431 , 94 / 12 / 11 ) about " grasshopper mind , " an expression that is entered into kenkyusha 's japanese - english and english - japanese dictionaries ( 1974 , 1980 ) and roget 's thesaurus ( 1982 ) , but apparently not found in any monolingual english dictionaries . the respondents , in alphabetical order , were : deborah milam berkley , marie egan , ted harding , steven schaufele , steve seegmiller , todd sieling , and stephen p . spackman . the inquiry asked four questions : ) do other english language reference works enter " the grasshopper mind " ? ) is it a varietal or dialectal term ? when was it first recorded ? are ) there analogous " grasshoppery " words in other languages ? ( 1 ) looking up " grasshopper mind " in english dictionaries is a lexicographical dead end . i ' ve checked dozens - - including old and new , standard and slang , uk and us , - - and not one enters it . some larger dictionaries record a derogatory sense of _ grasshopper _ ; e . g . , the new shorter oxford english dictionary ( 1993 ) : " 2 . _ fig . _ a person held to resemble a grasshopper in character or behaviour ; an inconstant , flighty , or frivolous person . l16 . " and the near-synonym " grasshopper brain " is webster 's third new international dictionary ( 1971 ) usage example for _ grasshopper _ meaning 3 . 2 " light and frivolous : untouched by care for the future . " ( 2 ) harding definitively answers the second question : ) " grasshopper mind " is well-known standard uk english usage . to say ) someone " has a grasshopper mind " means that their focus of attention ) jumps unpredictably from subject to random subject . none of the other respondents , including three widely-dispersed speakers of american english ( berkley , egan , seegmiller ) , had seen or heard this collocation , but all agreed they could readily understand what it means . in terms of _ grasshopper _ meaning ' frivolous , careless , ' the semantics of " grasshopper mind " are fairly self-explanatory . ( 3 ) dating the " grasshopper mind " coinage is moot . harding says : ) i ' m sure it 's not particularly recent in origin . . . . i ' m pretty sure it ) must be possible to trace early uses of the phrase " grasshopper mind . " sieling suggests checking aesop 's " the ant and the grasshopper , " and funk & wagnalls new standard dictionary ( 1913 ) defines _ grasshoppering _ as : " 1 . an unsettled and unsteady course of life ; improvident living : from the fable of the grasshopper and the ant .

" fire " here translates " launch a projectile " ) and " stick " is the classifier for a rigid rod . " rigid projectile ) launcher " is not so snappy , but a rather tighter word than " gun " ) do n't you think ? the semantically transparent " grasshopper mind " reveals a lexicographical gap between english dictionaries published in the united states and the united kingdom . while unknown to most american anglophones and familiar to many uk anglophones , lexicographers have overlooked this metaphor for orthopterous mentality . modern lexicography is benefiting from computerized corpora and machine-readable dictionaries . for instance , searching for adjectival _ grasshopper _ + noun combinations in cobuilddirect 's on-line corpus ( direct @ cobuild . collins . co . uk ) reveals three occurrences of " grasshopper mind , " two of " grasshopper warbler , " and one each of " grasshopper leap , " " weather , " and " nijinsky . " many dictionaries enter _ grasshopper warbler _ ( locustella naevia , characterized by its buzzing call ) but none _ grasshopper mind _ . further research is necessary . any information about this expression 's historical origins or distributional usages ( seegmiller asks about australian english ) would be gratefully welcomed . michael carr , otaru university of commerce , otaru 047 japan email carr @ canal . otaru-uc . ac . jp fax 81 + ( 0 ) 134-22 - 0467

<subject> language policy </subject> admittedly , i ' m coming in on the middle of this discussion , having missed the earlier messages . however , i was struck by m . hale 's disturbing feelings about " references to such ( non-linguistic ) issues as " citizenship " and " ethnicity " " . how can you manage a language planning project without taking into consideration such non-linguistic factors , in addition to a study of language attitudes , government policies past and present , language of education and social mobility , etc . etc . ? and something else to think about perhaps . . . while the language planner ( s ) might not favor legal restrictions outright , the legal promotion of a language or languages , which seems like the opposite course , could actually lead to unofficial restrictions of the other language ( s ) . someone mentioned the case of spanish and english in the us . last week i heard a radio ( npr ? ) news report that some monolingual english speakers can't find work in the miami area because they do n't speak spanish ( the report was in reference to a politician 's support of making english the official language of the us ) . at a national / federal level , one could argue that spanish is a minority language ; at a local / city level , one could argue that it is not . do we have here a case of the promotion of spanish leading to unofficial restrictions on english - speakers , at least at a city level , in terms of employment opportunities ? my point is that the definition of " minority language " is going to depend on the specific situation . i am currently involved in a small-scale language planning project ( in the capacity of director ) and the toughest decisions i come across have to do with the " non-linguistic " factors : the people , the emotions , the feelings and the ideas they have towards the other people who do n't speak their language . even a small project is extremely complex . deborah du bartell , ph . d . linguistics program edinboro university of pennsylvania edinboro , pa 16444 usa 814-732 - 2736
<subject> words that are their own op </subject> regarding words that are their own opposites i ' ve thought of an example - the word 's hame ' in aboriginal english and standard australian english . for example , in the paul kelly ( standard australian english ) song , " special treatment " he describes an aboriginal boy who has had his family 's history hidden from him ( pushed off land , put in chains , children stolen etc etc ) as " i was raised in shame " . this is a negative description - he was made to feel bad about himself . in alice springs aboriginal english , being brought up with shame would be the ' right way ' to be brought up . having ' no shame ' indicates the wrong behaviour in the circumstances , that 's when you should feel bad about yourself ! this 's hift ' in meaning is due to the substrate languages having a word that people translate into 's hame ' in english , when that 's not exactly what is meant , eg ' apure ' , eastern arrernte , and ' kurnta ' in warlpiri . this has been discussed by jean harkins in the australian journal of linguistics , and in her book " into another world " . so . . . what does it mean to be shameless ? sue morrish , teacher linguist , institute for aboriginal development , alice springs northern territory , australia 0870 .

<subject> sum : function words </subject> i . the question and its motivation three weeks ago or so , i asked linguist readers to help me find examples of function words with unusually specific meanings . this was meant to elicit examples that i could mention in a paper called " the formal semantics of grammaticalization " , where i discuss what happens to the meaning of a content morpheme that develops into a function morpheme . i argue there , developing work by other semanticists / logicians , that ( 1 ) function morphemes do have meanings ( contrary to a widespread assumption ) . just consider that the meanings of quantifiers , tense , aspect , modals , etc . are the bread and butter of us working semanticists . ( 2 ) there is a class of " logical " meanings that have certain formal properties ( permutation-invariance , high types ) . ( 3 ) unfortunately , there is no perfect correlation between logical meanings and functional morphemes . there are lexical / content morphemes with ( almost ) logical meanings ( adjectives " same " , " mere " , " alleged " , verbs " deny " , " believe " , nouns " majority " , etc . ) . and there might be functional morphemes with non-logical meanings ( hence the linguist query ) . ( 4 ) thus there is not much that we can say about what happens to the meaning of a morpheme that is becoming grammaticalized . although i make some presumably doomed efforts . the finished paper ( which is based on a talk i gave at the nels 25 workshop on language change ) will appear in the nels 25 proceedings ( to be available from the glsa at umass amherst , glsa @ linguist . umass . edu ) . the paper is downloadable by anonymous ftp from the following url : ftp : / / broca . mit . edu / pub / fintel / gramma . ps i would welcome any comments . ii . some of the responses : mark robert hale ( hale1 @ alcor . concordia . ca ) wrote : ) the reference [ to the pejorative pronouns " you shit " ] ) is samuel elbert 's grammar of ) rennellese / bellona , " echo of a culture : a grammar ) of rennell and bellona " , uhawaii press 1988 ) [ oceanic linguistics special publication no . 22 ] . ) ) a few interesting cases of ) grammaticalization of a somewhat relevant ) type do exist . in micronesian languages ) there are a set of verbal affixes for ) directionality ( up , down , towards speaker , ) towards hearer , towards some third ) party [ the usual deixis system ] ) which ) also include " toward the open ocean " ) and " toward the lagoon " ; whereas ( of course ) ) if you want to say " toward john 's house " ) ( or some other nonce collocation ) ) you need to use a pp . ) ) similar , but probably not similar enough , ) is the bizarre use of the cardinal directionals ) in icelandic documented in a classic paper ) by einar haugen ( i can dig up the reference ) if you really want it ) . it seems like , being ) predominantly coastal inhabitants , and having ) a rather uneven fjorded coastline , to go ) to a city which was north of you actually ) involved heading out in a southerly ) direction ( all that time ) .

<subject> sum : more discussion of human and non-human language </subject> content - length : 18462 there 's been a fair amount of discussion about language among non-humans , both publicly on linguist and privately with me , since my previous summa - ry in linguist 6-28 . i have already posted to linguist a bibliographical list , broadcast in linguist 6-195 ; here follows a summary of some of the main points that have come up in discussion . first of all , i 'd like to thank the following people who posted messages to me personally : dan alford , a . k . a . moonhawk ( dalford @ s1 . csuhayward . edu ) celso alvarez - caccamo ( lxalvarz @ udc . es ) rachel lagunoff ( ihw1009 @ mvs . oac . ucla . edu ) dorothy hinshaw patent ( doropatent @ aol . com ) john e . limber ( jel @ christa . unh . edu ) alex schwartz ( alex _ schwartz @ sagepub . com ) andrew spencer ( spena @ essex . ac . uk ) mike tomasello ( tomas @ fs1 . psy . emory . edu ) bill turkel ( bill @ hivnet . ubc . ca ) george williams ( gww @ navisoft . com ) in addition to these individuals , the following people have posted items on the subject of language among nonhumans to linguist since 6-28 . i ' m going to focus less on these in the following summary , on the assumption that most of you have already read what they had to say . lloyd anderson ( ecoling @ applelink . apple . com ) sherri l . condon ( slc6859 @ usl . edu ) jane a . edwards ( edwards @ cogsci . berkeley . edu ) larry gorbet ( lgorbet @ mail . unm . edu ) jacques guy ( j . guy @ trl . oz . au ) gilbert harman ( ghh @ princeton . edu ) marion kee ( marion . kee @ a . nl . cs . cmu . edu ) bob krovetz ( krovetz @ cs . umass . edu ) roger lass ( roger @ beattie . uct . ac . za ) david pesetsky ( pesetsk @ mit . edu ) benji wald ( ibeneawj @ mvs . oac . ucla . edu ) sherman wilcox ( wilcox @ alcor . unm . edu ) one major issue that came up in discussion was the methodological and ethical justification of evaluating the linguistic ability of non-humans by confronting them with the task of mastering a language belonging to homo sapiens , instead of by investigating the means by which they inter - act amongst themselves . in linguist , benji wald pointed out that chomsky himself , in a paper pub - lished in the sebeok / sebeok vol . mentioned in my bibliography in linguist 6-195 , carefully drew the distinction between ' human language ' , the cog - nitive system built into the * human * brain that enables us to master the various human languages that are the raw data of our studies , and ' lan - guage ' ( which i shall in this posting capitalize - - not to be confused with lsa 's journal ) , the set of all possible similar systems , in whatever species ( or machine ) they may manifest themselves . this phase of the dis - cussion began with the question of the relation between an ability to re - cognize one 's image in a mirror and an ability to handle pronouns of vari - ous sorts , including reflexives . ( briefly , dogs and cats are able to re - cognize their reflections as members of their own species but consistently treat them as ' others ' , behaving toward them as they would to strangers of their own species ; roger lass has suggested that the ability to re - cognize the reflection as 's elf ' may not be evolutionarily advantageous to such predatory animals . the anthropoid apes , however , manage after a few minutes to realize that the reflection is 's elf ' , at which point they switch from the 's ocial ' behaviours they would normally use to make the acquaintance of strangers of their own species to using the mirror as a tool for self-inspection . but there has been no evidence presented , to my knowledge or that of anyone else on the list , that chimps , gorillas , etc . have any ability to handle anaphoric reference the way human apes do . sherri condon referred us to the work of her colleague at the univer - sity of southwestern louisiana , daniel j . povinelli , on this subject . ) but ultimately this discussion came back to a fundamental issue raised in my previous summary : even were it possible , through ingenious programme design and / or arduous effort , to teach a real human language to a chimp or a gorilla , the mere fact that the system in question would have to be ' force-fed ' , as it were , is evidence in itself that there is a serious difference between the cognitive systems of the two species ( human and non-human ) in question , since humans pick the stuff up with almost no training whatsoever . since much of our research programme is dedicated , more or less directly , to investigating the ability of humans to learn individual human languages ' naturally ' ( i . e . , with a minimum of effort ) - - at least in childhood - - this unredoubted fact places the linguistic abilities of non-humans at a significant distance from our discipline 's focus area . whether the field of linguistics ought to broaden its focus area to include non-human quasi-linguistic semiotic / communicative systems is another question , of course , that was raised in private discussion with me . speaking for myself , i am very sympathetic to the notion of embedding ( to use a very professional word ) linguistics as we now under - stand it within a broader programme of research into language , including the semiotic / communicative systems of non-human animals . supposing that such animals could accomplish the task of mastering a hu - man language ( which has so far not happened ) , this would certainly prove that the difference in species is not relevant to the nature of the lan - guage in question , much less language in general . but failure to accom - plish the task is not as probative , since it can be interpreted in either of at least two ways : ( 1 ) the animals in question are no more than ' protolinguistic ' ( to use bickerton 's term ) , unable to master a system of the complexity of human language - - a quantitative evaluation . ( 2 ) the animals in question are already in possession of an equivalent system of comparable complexity but of incompatible organization ( which ipso facto interferes catastrophically with the proposed task ) - - a qua - litative evaluation . which of these alternatives is correct will require a completely diffe - rent set of experiments , carefully studying the communicative behaviours natural to these animals as we linguists study the communicative beha - viours natural to humans . one of my correspondents said , ' why is all this effort devoted towards teaching apes a modified version of english ? a complex and highly social species such as this has an extremely sophisticated natural communication system of its own , yet we know very little about this . . . surely , before embarking on experimental meddling of dubious methodological validity , it would be more prudent to construct a research program aimed at mapping out the cognitive abilities of the various species and more particularly , their home-grown communication systems . presumably , it 's only against the background of how apes communicate with each other in the wild that we will really be able to interpret the kinds of artificial experiments pio - neered by the gardners and others . . . when you provide the reference list it would be extremely interesting ( though a lot of hard work ) to compare the amount of research effort expended on teaching apes 2 - year old english , compared to the number of studies devoted to ethological study of ape communication . ' a further , related issue was the epistemological question of how to reco - gnize behaviour in another species that is equivalent to language in hu - mans . i remarked myself at one point , ' human language is not purely a communication system , and its structure is not based solely on its commu - nicative function . i use language for a variety of functions . . . it does not strike me as logically self-evident that all of these functions should be served by the same system . i can imagine a species that en - gaged in all of these behaviours but used a radically different system for each . would we be able to recognize all these different systems ? and would all of them properly fall into the field of inquiry we call ' lin - guistics ' ? larry gorbet , in his linguist posting , touched very well on a further as - pect of this problem , addressing in particular one of the criticisms that has been made of the results achieved by the gardners et al . ' any formal element whose meaning includes displacement ( or more generally , * any * fairly abstract meaning ) will be intrinsically difficult to recognize as such , simply because the " search space " ( for the observable behavior that points to meaning ) is so large . the result is an * intrinsic * sample bias in semantic analysis : concrete meanings are more likely to be * disco - vered * than are more abstract ones , relative to their actual frequency of occurrence . in addition to abstract meanings in the more obvious sense , meanings which concern internal states ( e . g . " emotions " ) can be difficult to discern if one does n't experience those states or similar ones . ' a couple of references to the science fiction literature are relevant here , science fiction being often very useful for such ' thought-experi - ments ' in the einsteinian sense . h . beam piper , who while definitely not pc was brilliant , wrote a story called ' naudsonce ' ( pp . 57-112 in the col - lection federation , published 1981 by ace . piper suicided in 1964 , and i have no idea whether ' naudsonce ' was published anywhere during his life - time ) , in which an exploration party from earth discovers an extrasolar planet inhabited by an obviously sapient species which the explorers la - bel ' svants ' . these people are living at roughly a neolithic cultural / technological level , and there 's no question that they communicate by means of deliberately modulated sound waves transmitted through the air , so the humans immediately jump to the conclusion that they have something akin to what we call ' language ' , and the professional linguist they ' ve brought along for just such eventualities gets to work trying to analyse the svants ' ' language ' and establish inter-species communication . no go . turns out that although both svants and humans communicate by means of deliberately modulated , etc . , the resemblance ends there . our auditory systems ( by which i mean both the auditory centers of our brains and the neurosensory systems in our ears that serve as their input ) are designed to convert auditory impulses into a distinct sensory experience that we call ' hearing ' . the svants ' neurosensory systems are designed to convert such impulses into something more closely approximating the sensory expe - rience that tells us about our internal states ( e . g . , feelings of hunger , thirst , satiation , heartburn , etc . ) . thus , when a human reports a feel - ing of pain or pleasure , another human apprehends the message intellectu - ally ; when a svant reports such a feeling , an equivalent feeling is di - rectly induced in the body of another svant . in order to have any hope of inter-species communication , the human explorers have to rely on two peculiar individuals : a young male svant who is as a result of a birth defect 'd eaf ' , but is otherwise quite intelligent and shows promise of being able to master an ideographic writing system , and his mother , who is ' normal ' but sticks with her son out of maternal affection , and can interpret for him to the rest of the svant community . my point in giving this rather lengthy summary is that recognition of the fundamental diffe - rence between the human and svant communicative systems constitutes a ma - jor , and very challenging , cognitive leap for the human explorers ; can we be confident that a similar cognitive leap would not be necessary for us in evaluating the cognitive behaviours of non-human apes , cetaceans , etc . ? ( piper , speaking through some of his characters , expresses scepticism that a species whose principal communication system so thoroughly bypas - ses the ' higher / rational ' cognitive centers can develop very far in the way of civilization . i personally do n't share his scepticism . several of us during discussion have considered that cetaceans use sound both as their principal means of exploring the world around them , via sonar , and apparently to communicate . this suggests that a cetacean mode of commu - nication might involve ' projecting ' a sonar ' image ' of what one is talk - ing about into the listener 's brain . such projection may involve vocali - zation skill levels outside the abilities of cetaceans ; but assuming they could do it , i do n't think such 'd irect ' communicative methods preclude a high level of civilization . i ' m not sure they ' re all that different from the ability of the chinese , or of fluent signers , to communicate highly abstract concepts by means of what is essentially visual imagery . ) those of you who have read suzette hayden elgin 's intriguing though dif - fuse novel native tongue may remember that in that novel , humans , having over the course of several decades established contact with a variety of alien species and managed to negotiate profitable trade deals with seve - ral of them in spite of the obvious language barriers ( the only reason the generally despised profession of ' linguist ' is allowed to survive in this crypto-fascist state ) , encounters a species that is obviously sapi - ent and obviously endowed with something in the way of a language ( if i remember correctly , it 's not made clear exactly how this is recognized ) , but that ' language ' is so radically different from human language in its structural organization that no human seems to be able to get the hang of it ( several people die trying ) . in both cases , we are left with the big question : what , exactly , consti - tutes language , or a ' language ' ? and how do we recognize one if it exists ? on the subject of the cognitive organization of the brains of non-human primates , steven pinker , on p . 350 of his recent book the language ins - tinct : how the mind creates language , discusses their equivalents of broca 's and wernicke 's areas : ' the neuroanatomists al galaburda and terrence deacon have discovered areas in monkey brains that correspond in location , input-output cabling , and cellular composition to the human language areas . for example , there are homologues to wernicke 's and broca 's areas and a band of fibers connecting the two , just as in humans . the regions are not involved in producing the monkeys ' calls , nor are they involved in producing their gestures . the monkey seems to use the regions corresponding to wernicke 's area and its neighbors to recognize sound sequences and to discriminate the calls of other monkeys from its own calls . the broca 's homologues are involved in control over the mus - cles of the face , mouth , tongue , and larynx , and various subregions of these homologues receive inputs from the parts of the brain dedicated to hearing , the sense of touch in the mouth , tongue , and larynx , and areas in which streams of information from all the senses converge . ' for those of you who are interested , the relevant references are : deacon , t . w . 1988 .

' role of architectonics and con - nections in the study of primate brain evolution ' in e . armstrong & d . falk , eds . , primate brain evolution . new york : plenum . beyond this , there is the fact that the integration of even complex so - cial systems is not enough to account for the complexity of human lan - guage . a large number of human social situations seem to be manageable by just a few dozen different utterances ; yet we have a natural linguis - tic ability vastly in excess of that . i suspect that our ancestors may have developed that ability through some nonce mutation , and then over the subsequent millenia have gradually developed uses for it . ( for some at least tangentially relevant thoughts on this subject , see theodore zeldin 's recently published intimate history of humanity , harper - collins . ) before closing this posting , i will quote the following from dorothy hinshaw patent 's message to me , and reiterate my plea in linguist 6-28 for more user-friendliness in our interactions with people who are rea - sonably intelligent , may be well-educated , may even be fellow scientists , but just are n't linguists . ' i was very frustrated by the critics of the ape language work ; they seemed to be looking for reasons to say the work did n't have meaning , and i think your piece summarized many of the frustrations of people like me very well . would that everyone were able to think so clearly ! what i 'd like to see is a linguistic analysis - - using minimal linguistic jargon , so zoologists and psychologists could understand it , too - - of the work done with apes , dolphins , sea lions , and parrots , comparing the " accom - plishments " of the different species to one another and to human chil - dren . i 'd like the person doing it to make the assumption , as you have , that the work does have meaning , and go from there , rather than trying to find picky reasons for discounting it because of human hubris . ' let us instead adopt the attitude expressed by sherri condon : ' i think we have much to learn about cognition and communication in all species , and we are fortunate that careful researchers are on the job . ' of course , as is always true not * all * researchers ' on the job ' are ' careful ' , by which i understand ' responsible , not wedded to their hypotheses to such an ex - tent that they are unable to wrestle appropriately with contrary evidence or alternative approaches ' , but the responsible ones definitely deserve encouragement ! best , steven - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - dr . steven schaufele 712 west washington urbana , il 61801 217-344 - 8240 fcosws @ prairienet . org * * * * o syntagmata linguarum liberemini humanarum ! * * * * * * nihil vestris privari nisi obicibus potestis ! * * *
<subject> obligatory affixes : summary </subject> several weeks ago i asked how the traditional notion of obligatory affixes was recast in the theory of realizational morphology . the responce was not exactly overwhelming , but i wish to thank greg stump ( eng101 @ ukcc . uky . edu ) , don ringe ( dringe @ unagi . cis . upenn . edu ) , r . beard ( rbeard @ coral . bucknell . edu ) , and andrew carstairs - mccarthy ( a . c-mcc @ ling . canterbury . ac . nz ) for helpful responses . a few responses ( slightly edited ) : greg stump : in paradigm function theory , a language 's inventory of morphosyntactic features is assumed to determine - - for any major syntactic category x - - a paradigm schema : a set of cells each of which is associated with a complete and fully specified set of morphosyntactic feature specifications appropriate to category x . in latin , for example , the features of case ( i . e . nominative , genitive , dative , accusative , ablative ) , number ( singular , plural ) , and gender ( masculine , feminine , neuter ) determine a paradigm schema for adjectives which consists of thirty cells , one for each of the case / number / gender combinations for which adjectives may be inflected . an adjective 's paradigm is then viewed as the inventory of inflected forms assigned to these cells . for any given cell c in the adjectival paradigm schema , there is a corresponding paradigm function which applies to an adjectival lexeme l to yield the inflected form of l assigned to c . paradigm functions are defined in terms of more specific morphological rules , including rules of exponence and rules of referral ; two or more of these may come into competition in the evaluation of a given paradigm function , in which case the narrower rule overrides the more general . how , then , is the notion of obligatory affixes recast in this theory ? notice first that the architecture of the theory guarantees that every inflected word w of category x will be associated with a complete and fully specified set of morphosyntactic feature specifications appropriate to x , and that it is this set of specifications that drives the inflection of w . in other words , it is the morphology , not ( pace anderson ) the syntax , that ` ensures that any given word has all the features required by the affixes in question ' . ( naturally , i assume that a lexeme 's invariant feature specifications - - e . g . a noun 's gender - - are simply supplied by its lexical entry . ) second , if a particular affix position must be filled , then that position can be assumed to be associated with a set of rules of affixal exponence the least narrow of which functions as the default for that position . [ i have some questions about how that works where the choice of one affix seems to require the presence of morphosyntactic features which are otherwise absent , but it may be that all such examples could be reanalyzed . it would be unfair of me to say more until i ' ve had a chance to correspond with greg . - - mm ] [ some references : ] ` a paradigm-based theory of morphosemantic mismatches ' , _ language _ 67 ( 1991 ) , 675-725 . ` on the theoretical status of position class restrictions on inflectional affixes ' , in _ yearbook of morphology 1991 _ , ed . by geert booij and jaap van marle , 211-241 .

<subject> workshop announcement articulatory databases </subject> workshop on articulatory databases munich thursday 25th and friday 26th may , 1995 we are currently starting the preparations for a two-day workshop on articulatory databases . this will be the third in the series of workshops organized by the accor working group ( a consortium of phonetic institutes financed by the european community 's esprit programme ) and and follows the electromagnetic articulography meeting in munich ( april , 1992 ) , and the tongue modelling meeting in barcelona ( december 1993 ) . a few words on the aims of a meeting devoted to such an apparently dry topic : the basic premise is that the free availability of articulatory data could provide benefits in several partly overlapping areas : in basic research it could allow investigators to test hypotheses formulated in articulatory terms on a much wider range of data than the individual worker would normally be able to acquire or access unaided . it could promote the development and testing of algorithms for deriving articulatory representations from acoustic data - relevant both for basic understanding of speech production as well as in potential applications such as speech displays for training the speech impaired . it could promote the development and testing of algorithms for speech synthesis / recognition using an articulatory level of representation . the aim of the workshop would be to generate an exchange of ideas among people active in these areas in order to identify , for example ( further suggestions welcome ) : 1 ) what articulatory data is in existence that it would be beneficial to make more freely available ( archival / retrospective approach ) ? 2 ) what standards should freely available data meet ? - specification of recording conditions - anatomical frames of reference - levels of accuracy / reliability - linguistic specification of the speech samples - preferred data structures for distribution . - any other issues relevant to the data being used without risk of misinterpretation by people not actually involved in the the details of acquisition articulatory data can come in many guises depending on the speech subsystem tapped into and the transduction technique used . thus , it is possible to monitor position ( 1 , 2 or 3 dimensions ) , force , emg , airpressure / flow with techniques that may be static or dynamic , may involve imaging or point-tracking etc . etc . we think that people directly involved in acquisition can also benefit from considering how techniques can be standardized to promote maximum comparability of recordings made at different sites and with different hardware . 3 ) in analogy to acoustic databases ( where unlabelled data is of only the most limited use ) , what segmentation and labelling information ( and tools for the exploitation thereof ) could / should be made available with the raw data to facilitate flexible access for different purposes ? 4 ) for future recordings , what categories of data and corpora would be potentially of most widespread use ? if you are interested in participating please contact phil hoole ( preferably by email ) at the address below as soon as possible . further information on registration and format for presentations will be distributed early in 1995 . please also draw this letter to the attention of any colleagues you think might be interested . phil hoole and hans tillmann institut fuer phonetik munich university schellingstr . 3 d - 80799 munich germany fax : + 49 89 2800362 email : hoole @ sun1 . phonetik . uni-muenchen . de

<subject> whatever happened to 'd ? </subject> dear subscribers , recently i came across an example of better used without had in the following construction : she better stop . as it was an american publication , i assumed that the use of had in such expressions had completely disappeared , in written as well as spoken us english . i would not have been surprised to find that it had disappeared from spoken usage , since there are obvious phonological reasons , but the loss of it in writing indicated to me that the use of better alone was quite standardised . this poses a question for me , and i was wondering if anyone out there has a suggestion . if it is now standardised , and there is no longer a had , why does n't the former bare infinitive stop now become finite and take 3ps inflection ( ? she better stops ) ? is this because it now has assumed a subjunctive-like quality ? can it then be associated with the expression : it is better that she stop ? if so , can another adjective be substituted for better here , e . g . it is good that she stop ) ? ? she good stop ? how has this been reanalysed , and what are the implications ? ( susan dopke informs me that some grammarians have interpreted better in these contexts as an auxiliary , and if that is the case , can we use sub-aux inversion to make it a question ? ( ? better she stop ? ) is this now acceptable too ? please send your suggestions if this bothers you . debbie ziegeler
<subject> seminar : the conservation of endangered languages </subject> the centre for theories of language and learning university of bristol department of philosophy announces a seminar on the conservation of endangered languages friday april 21st 1995 at 9 woodland rd , bristol bs8 1tb , england according to reliable estimates , half of the world 's six thousand languages will become extinct in the next century . furthermore , two thousand of the remaining three thousand languages will be threatened during the century after next . in the uk these startling facts have recently received media attention , stimulated partly by the publication this year of the atlas of the world 's languages , edited by christopher moseley and r . e . asher ( routledge ) . the rapid decline is largely due to a mixture of economic and political pressures affecting communities that speak minority languages , pressures which remove the new generation 's motivation for communicating in their traditional language . the problem of language-extinction raises fundamental questions . what is the value of these threatened languages to science and to humankind in general ? what principles might justify us in striving to keep small languages alive ? what reasons are there for preserving them in archive form ? the seminar is aimed primarily at academics from such disciplines as philosophy , ethics , anthropology , linguistics , sociolinguistics , cultural history , ecology and population biology , but is open to all interested persons . seminar programme registration desk opens 9 . 30a . m . 10-11 am mapping the future of the world 's languages mr . christopher moseley , co - editor of atlas of the world 's languages 1994 11-12 should linguistic diversity be preserved ? dr . mark pagel , dept of zoology , oxford university 12 - 1 who wants to learn a native language in latin america ? prof . marcelo dascal , inst . of advanced studies , hebrew university of jerusalem 1 - 2 lunch 2 - 3 thinking twice : issues in welsh as a second language in children under 5 ms . sian wyn siencyn , language consultant , author of the sound of europe 3 - 4 orchestrating language revival mr . allan wynne jones , european bureau for lesser used languages 4 - 6 round table and discussion with contributions from the floor * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * seminar registration form i should like to register for the one day seminar at bristol university and enclose my cheque for the amount stated below . signature : name ( capitals ) : address and telephone : e-mail : accomodation wanted ? a limited amount of single bed and breakfast accomodation can be provided near to the seminar venue , at a cost of 22 uk pounds per night ( standard room ) or 36 uk pounds ( en suite room ) . b&b night of thursday 20th april : _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ b&b night of friday 21st april : _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ total ( accomodation ) : _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ registration fee : 5 uk pounds total : _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ please send this form and cheque payable to ' the university of bristol ' to : ctll , graduate studies centre , 7 woodland road , bristol bs8 1tb uk . for further information , contact the seminar organisers dan brickley and andrew woodfield ( email : centre-tll @ bristol . ac . uk ) a background article on the topic is also available by email or by accessing the ctll world wide web pages using the following internet url : http : / / www . bris . ac . uk / depts / philosophy / ctll / index . html

<subject> release of agfl home page </subject> this message announces the release of the world wide web home page of agfl ( affix grammars over a finite lattice ) . 1 . agfl the agfl formalism , developed at the university of nijmegen , the netherlands , is a formalism in which context free grammars can be described compactly . agfls are two level grammars : a first , context free level is augmented with features for expressing agreement between parts of speech . features are treated as types , and their values may range over the subsets of a given finite set , which explains the acronym affix grammars over a finite lattice . agfl grammars are transformed into a parser by the parser generator opt . the generated parser is a recursive backup parser which computes the values of the affixes on the fly . in this way , fast and efficient parsers can be generated . the formalism is quite simple and limited , and therefore easy to read and write . agfl comes with a grammar workbench gwb , supporting the development of grammars and the checking of their consistency . the agfl formalism does not require any special hardware . the parser generator opt runs on regular sparc - systems and ms-dos machines ( 386 or higher ) and is relatively small . for instance , the ms-dos version requires less than 1 mb harddisk space . 2 . agfl on the web agfl has now been made available to the ( computational ) linguistic community . we think it can be used by ( computational ) linguists who are in need of a simple grammar formalism with a fast parser generator , suitable for experimental purposes . therefore , we have made agfl available via ftp and , recently , via www . the agfl home page contains information about the agfl formalism like the agfl manual , documentation and papers , sample grammars and the latest developments . there is also the possibility to download the software and to register yourself as an agfl user . you are invited to take a look at the home page and to read the information or to download the software . please feel free to make use of agfl and its home page ; we look forward to hear about your experiences . we are currently planning an agfl workshop in june . the latest news about this workshop can also be found on the agfl home page . the url of the agfl home page is : http : / / www . cs . kun . nl / agfl / the address of the ftp - site is : ftp : / / hades . cs . kun . nl / pub / agfl / the organisation of the www page should be self-explanatory . the structure of the ftp - site is as follows : - readme - doc : this directory contains a number of relevant papers - pc386 : this directory contains software for ms-dos machines and an installation guide . - sun4 : this directory contains software for sparc - stations and an installation guide . any questions or remarks with respect to agfl or the agfl home page can be sent to : www-agfl @ cs . kun . nl . on behalf of the agfl team , erik oltmans department of computer science university of nijmegen the netherlands

<subject> item for linguist </subject> in memoriam simon c . dik ( 1940-1995 ) it is with great sadness that we inform you of the death , on march 1 , 1995 , of simon c . dik , one of the world 's leading theoreticians in functional linguistics . simon had occupied the chair of general linguistics at the university of amsterdam for 25 years when in 1994 his illness , which had manifested itself two years earlier , forced him to resign . during these 25 years he developed the theory of functional grammar , the foundations for which had been laid in his 1968 dissertation on coordination . as far as his illness allowed him , simon continued working on the further development of this theory until his death . the results of this work , the two-volume ' the theory of functional grammar ' , will be published posthumously . during his career simon has been a constant source of inspiration and encouragement , both as a teacher and as a scholar , for his colleagues and students . the significance of his work for the field of linguistics and the effectivity of the enormous energy which he put into promoting linguistic research deserve our recognition and gratitude . we , members of the community of linguists working within the framework of functional grammar , especially feel the loss of our personal contacts with him . we gratefully acknowledge his unending and invaluable involvement in the progress of linguistic research until the very end . simon leaves behind his wife willy , his daughters iris and hester , and his son remco . machtelt bolkestein ( ot @ alf . let . uva . nl ) casper de groot ( casperdg @ alf . let . uva . nl ) kees hengeveld ( khengeveld @ alf . let . uva . nl )

<subject> j . r . firth 's ' context of situation ' </subject> thanks to the following people who kindly responded to my inquiry into work which attempts to apply j . r . firth 's notion of ' context of situation ' to studies of discourse : tom craven gudula stegmann graham mcgregor joe foley koenraad kuiper richard ogden in summary , it appears that although firth 's notion is familiar to many sociolinguists , discourse and conversation analysts - as evidenced in references typically appearing in overviews on the notion of ' context ' - surprisingly little work has been , or is being , actually undertaken on the topic . a reference where this phenomenon is exemplified is the introductory chapter in duranti , a . & goodwin , c . ( 1992 ) ( eds . ) rethinking context . cup . koenraad kuiper reports that he has a forthcoming paper which offers a reappraisal of the origins of the term ' context of situation ' ; graham mcgregor has conducted an ( unpublished ) study of person-reference which incorporates firth 's notion into his analytical approach . i shall be happy to inform readers of the list of my future uncoverings of applied firthian linguistics . alan firth aalborg university , denmark

<subject> re : 6 . 199 ipa </subject> why must this kind of stuff be decided by a vote ? since obviously ipa membership does not equal interest in the matter and never will , all that will be achieved if some of us join the ipa just to force this issue , is that it will be " packed " in some other way than the way it is now , but it will never be representative . why not let the invisible hand of the " market " of ideas operate freely instead ? as fewer and fewer people use ipa 's made-up symbols , either that organization will become completely irrelevant , or it will make up its own mind to respond to the " market forces " , or perhaps some other group will step in and by proposing a system that is manifestly better than anyone else 's , achieve standardization that way . i really think that if a few of the top names in phonetics got together with the editors of a few journals , they could probably come up with something . it could also simply come from anywhere else : if someone were to publish a truly superior system and people started using it . finally , in reality , it seems that certain trends are occurring anyway and that in particular the resistance to the hachek and the use of the corresponding ipa symbols are on the wane . if we can put up with the inconsistencies of american vs . canadian vs . british spelling , we can probably do just as well here . and if we are gonna worry about something , i would worry more about those cases where te same symbols have different commonly used meanings like ' j ' and ' y ' . alexis mr

<subject> re : 6 . 108 sum : words that are their own opposites ( part 2 ) </subject> after attending a meeting , i heard someone say , " the acceptance of this plan will depend on its oversight . " i immediately thought of the meaning : " an unintentional omission or mistake " ( ahd ) . what was intended , however , was another meaning : " watchful care or management ; supervision " ( ahd ) . the latter meaning , i think , is becoming the more common one , but it still startles me . in the same way , synonyms may become antonyms in compounds . " to oversee " is quite different from " to overlook . " i would also point out that nonstandard " borrow " for " lend " is still heard . it may have about the same distribution as " learn " to mean " teach . " up to at least the sixties , english textbooks for high schools carried stern admonitions for both . so these uses must have been quite common . finally , there is the famous " bad " of black english , which signifies its opposite . antithetical meanings may be common in slang for their shock value . " man , she 's one tough babe , " could indicate two quite contrasting , if not opposite meanings .
<subject> re : 6 . 293 words that are their own opposites </subject> sue morrish 's posting on shame in australian reminded me of a weird fact about the same word in south african english , according to some sa friends . this is that " shame ! " is used as an exclamation of joy by , for example , old ladies seeing a newborn baby or a fluffy animal . the supposed explanation is that " shame ! " as an exclamation of disapproval became an exclamation of sympathy for somebody who has been ill-treated ( so far , this parallels a shift that i ' m familiar with too ) . it then bleached out still further in sa to a mere " back channel utterance " , indicating that the listener was still paying ( sympathetic ) attention , and then became a positive expression of pleasure . can anybody confirm either the data or the explanation ? btw , wrt benji wald 's posting , i understood the origin of a ' lucus a non lucendo ' to be st isidore of seville 's _ origines sive etymologiae _ ( 7th c ) - according to father dinneen 's book on the history of linguistics i think . john t waterman in his little book perspectives on linguistics ( 1963 ) gives another example from the same source : bellum ( war ) from bellus ( beautiful ) , because war is far from beautiful ! regards , paul werth
<subject> human and non - human languages </subject> bearing on the question of primate language skills is the observation that they appear not to imitate the * manner * of doing something - - controverting the " monkey see , monkey do " saw . a clue as to why people have cultures and languages and primates do not came up in a national geographic series on primate research that i saw a few weeks ago . they had shown some chimps using sticks to poke through holes in a " beehive " and suck off honey , introducing the topic of tool use . in the next segment , the researcher had some candy on a table surrounded by some sort of cage with vertical bars . he had a primitive kind of rake with three wide-spaced tines resting on the table , the handle through the bars . the chimp had the same , on an adjacent section of the table . if the tines were down , they could n't get the candy because the wide-spaced tines could n't retain it . the researcher demonstrated flipping the rake over . with the back of the rake on the table top , it was easy to pull the candy to one 's hand . no matter how often he saw it , the chimp did n't get it . the inference from this and other experiments was that the primate perceives use of the tool to accomplish the end , but does not attend to the manner of using the tool . in the next segment , there is a similar setup with a small child . the child fails with the tines down . then the adult demonstrates flipping his rake over . the child immediately , on the next turn , does the same , even moving the rake through a curving path very much like that executed by the adult 's rake , to capture the object ( a block ) and pull it back to the edge . in support of this hypothesis , i believe there are no observations of cultural differences between one community of primates and another comparable to differences of human " body language " style and linguistic dialect - - differences in the manner of doing the " same " things , functionally inconsequential differences such that " we " do these things this way and " they " do the same things that way . bruce nevin bn @ lightstream . com

<subject> aaas </subject> what follows are the minutes of the meeting of section z - linguistics and the language science - - held during the atlanta aaas annual meeting . the section committee hopes that this will be of interest to all linguists and once again urges any linguist not yet a member of aaas to join and select section z as their priary affiliation . ( a membership form follows the minutes ) v . fromkin , section z , secretary = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = section z - - linguistics & the language sciences section meeting - february 17 , 1995 , 2 : 30 - 5 : 30 pm marriott marquis , atlanta , ga . minutes attendance : retiring chair barbara lust , chair , richie kayne , chair - elect stephen anderson , chair elect 1995 sarah thomason , secretary , vicki fromkin , members of steering committee : paul chapin , ilse lehiste , paul chapin , section z representative to aaas council , arnold zwicky , and 10-25 individuals ( 20 signed the attendance sheet ) . ( 1 ) the meeting was called to order and chaired by chair richie kayne . the attendees were asked to introduce themselves . ( 2 ) the minutes of the feb . 21 , 1993 section meeting were distributed and approved . ( 3 ) the results of the last election were reported : sarah ( sally ) thomason was elected chair - elect for 1995 , and david caplan was elected member at large 1995 - 1998 . the members of the steering committee for 1995 ( as of february 21 , 1995 ) therefore consist of : retiring chair richie kayne , chair stephen anderson , chair elect sarah thomason , secretary victoria a . fromkin , members - at - large : david caplan , paul chapin , ilse lehiste . arnold zwicky remains as the council delegate through 1996 . the chair expressed the appreciation of all members of section z to retiring chair barbara lust ( who will serve on the council in 1995 ) and david pesetsky . ( 4 ) four sessions were sponsored by section z at this meeting : bilingualism : when is the best age to learn a second language ? ; endangered languages ; linguistic science and language technology : machines and human language ; structures of language : batons for cognitive science and neuroscience . in addition , section z cosponsored a session organized by the psychology section : instincts to learn . kenneth hale presented one of the topical lectures - - the scientific cost of the global loss of linguistic diversity . ken hale s lecture and the session on endangered languages received a great deal of interest from the press . ( this issue made national press coverage by the time of the section meeting , ) the section extended its gratitude to the session organizers and speakers , and to ken hale for their efforts in bringing linguistics to the general scientific community at the aaas . ( 5 ) dr . susan speece , chair of the department of biological sciences at anderson university , anderson in , who has been appointed as education liaison from the education section to section z was introduced . she distributed copies of life science standards and curriculum development for k-12 and reported on the work of the science education reform committee of the national research council and asked for suggestions and input from our section regarding science education k-12 and also undergraduate science education . , a discussion followed in which it was announced that stephen crain is heading a committee of the linguistic society of american on linguistics in the curriculum which is also concerned with the teaching of linguistic science in the schools . it was suggested that crain be asked to contact dr . speece . individuals were urged to view the poster paper linguistics in the schools : developing an epistemology of science by maya honda and wayne o neil on display from 10 : 30 to 3 : 30 on saturday , february 18 , in the marriott south exhibit hall . this poster paper is directly related to the subject under discussion . ( 6 ) budget . vicki fromkin reported on the budget situation . up to this meeting , section z received $ 2500 / annum from the aaas office which was supposed to cover the travel expenses of the section officers for the annual meeting , refreshments , and any expenses of the ssponsored sessions ( organizers and speakers ) that could be provided . last year we offered no support to symposia speakers . thus , this year after subtracting the probable expenses of the officers , the section budget total came to approximately $ 2500 . symposia organizers sent their requests to vicki fromkin . after she determined the cheapest possible fares of the speakers , she divided the sum so that no speaker who had requested funds would suffer financially more than the others and recommended to the aaas staff that these sums be disbursed . this leaves the section with a zero balance . at the planning committee which she attended , vicki reported that the staff had decided to change the section budgets . the expenses of the officers would no longer be deducted from the section allocation but would be borne by the central office . however , the sections would now receive much lower allocations ; section z will only receive $ 1000 / annum . it is urgent that symposia organizers inform their invited speakers that there is little if any money for expenses and speakers should attempt to find money elsewhere . ( 7 ) 1996 aaas annual meeting , baltimore , maryland , 8-13 february 1996 . proposals for sessions are due april 1 , 1995 . a general discussion was held regarding sessions to be sponsored by section z . the section agreed that it would like to see the following session organized .

( 8 ) 1997 aaas annual meeting , seattle , washington . an opening discussion on possible sessions for the seattle meeting was held it was suggested that individuals should submit proposals to the nsf to fund sessions on reports of current research which would be of interest to the scientific community . such proposals should be submitted to paul chapin by no later than july 15 , 1995 in order to have a funding decision from nsf by december 1995 , in time to submit a session proposal to the aaas program committee . ( 9 ) membership . as of the time of the meeting , 169 members of aaas had selected section z as their primary affiliation , and according to mike spinella ( aaas staff , who attended the meeting briefly ) , 141 had designated section z as their secondary affiliation and 205 as their third . this total of 515 satisfies the aaas requirements for establishing section z as a permanent section of the aaas . in the words of mike spinella you re in ! . however , it is important that we continue to increase the members whose first affiliation is to our section . we would like to see that number grow to a minimum of 400 . in the discussion on methods to increase membership it was suggested that we ask the lsa if we can include a letter from the section chair and secretary in the regular mailings to linguistic department chairs asking if each department would subsidize the membership fee for one member ( probably the chair ) of the department . if the chair is already a member , another person should be designated , who could be elected by the faculty or determined in some other way . this would substantially increase our membership . sharon goldsmith from asha announced that she would be willing to place a notice in the asha newsletters and publications which go to 80 , 000 of their members . paul chapin agreed to draft a letter to send to asha for this purpose . it was also suggested that a membership form be included in the mailings . she also thanked section z for their support of the symposium on bilingualism which was organized by asha and introduced david kean , of the asha research and tehcnology committee . . barbara lust suggested that we contact all the international organizations such as lagb who supported the formation of the new section and ask them to publicize the section and urge their members to join . the question of the cost of joining aaas was discussed . there was confusion as to the cost of joining as a supporting member ( without receiving science ) particularly for foreign applicants . mike spinella assured us that supporting memberships cost $ 35 . 00 for us , and all non - us members . on the application form this $ 35 . fee is stated only for spouses of members , but we were assured that it is for anyone who joins as a supporting member . ( 10 ) endangered languages . michael strauss spoke on the importance of our establishing ties with non-linguists concerned with conservation and diversity , i . e . conservation biology , etc . david harmon of the george wright society of the world parks congress was introduced and told the group that until recently he did not realize the extent of the problem re maintaining linguistic diversity and the dangers facing endangered languages . he supported the suggestion that linguists concerned with this issue work together with other groups interested in cultural and biological diversity and endangered species . ( 11 ) at the 1994 meeting , it was agreed that it was important for linguists to submit research articles to science . this was reiterated . it was pointed out that one cannot complain about the contents of the journal and the heavy weighting toward biology if we do not submit articles . should they consistently be rejected we would then have grounds for complaint . ( 12 ) vicki fromkin announced that the international congress of linguists ( organized by the permanent international committee of linguistics , better known by its french initials cipl ) would be held in paris , in july of 1997 . ( 13 ) michael strauss , the director of annual meetings on the aaas staff and estrella m . triana , the senior program associate , aaas directorate for education & human resources programs were introduced . estrella triana announced that 1998 was the 150th anniversary of aaas and urged members to support the issuing of a aaas commemorative stamp . she also announced the fund raising drive for a new building , and reminded members that sections of the aaas were entitled to hold meetings in the aaas building in washington , dc . the meeting was adjourned submitted by v . fromkin , secretary section z = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = membership request form mail to : aaas - po box 2033 marion oh 43306-2133 or fax to ( 202 ) 842 1065 name _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ address _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ city _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ state _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ zip _ _ _ _ _ _ _ membership category : ( includes 51 issues of science ) * regular member $ 97 * postdoctoral $ 72 ( payment required with order , ) * student $ 50 ( payment & student id required ) supporting member $ 35 ( does not include science ) check enclosed _ _ _ bill me later _ _ _ ( regular members ) visa _ _ _ _ master card _ _ _ _ credit card number _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ exp date section z primary affiliation : _ _ _ _ ( check here ) * all include 51 issues of science .
<subject> sum . : history of capitalisation in english </subject> back in late january / early february i posted a query to linguist about sources on the history of capitalisation in english . several people responded asking me to post a summary to the list on any replies i might receive . my apologies for the delay , but i have been fighting three different winter " bugs " ( some viral , some bacterial ) since my original posting , and then had to rush to catch up on acadaemic commitments before the end of term ! anyway , here is the summary . . . . the most immediate " success " reply , so to speak , came from david denison at u . of manchester , u . k . : mrcepdd @ fsl . art . man . ac . uk . david suggested the following article : osselton , noel ( 1985 ) ' spelling - book rules and the capitalization of nouns in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries ' . in arn , mary - jo and hanneke wirtjes ( eds . ) . * * historical and editorial studies in medieval and modern english : for johan gerritsen . * * wolters - noordhoff , groningen , pp . 49-61 . to my delight , i found that " my " university library ( knight lib . at the u . of oregon ) had precisely this volume . the article ( chapter ) is only 6 pages long , but contains as well a list of spelling books and grammars , etc . to which osselton referred in the text . there is also a page of notes . this reference is the most useful i have yet seen , and i will be using it ( when i have the time ) as a foundation for finding more info . on this topic . a good place to start , i think . a reply from john e . koontz ( koontz @ bldr . nist . gov ) pointed me towards usenet lists which , i regret , i have not yet been able to try . john suggests comp . fonts , or hte repositories of past usenet postings ( he is not sure where they are ) , or the usenet faq collections . also , comp . text . larry rosenwald ( lrosenwald @ wellesley . edu ) suggested looking into the literature of printing history , as he reminded me that " in fact capitalization was often regularized by the printer . " henry rogers ( rogers @ epas . utoronto . ca ) wrote and remarked that " [ t ] he distinction between upper and lower case in the roman alphabet obviously developed in the writing of the middle ages . . . " i confess that my knowledge of the middle ages is not sufficient to know why this is " obvious " , and i have n't yet managed to contact henry to find out . do you have a moment to respond , please , henry ? eleanor olds batchelder ( eobgc @ cunyvm . cuny . edu ) suggested i might look at geoffrey nunberg 's writings , " esp . his history of punctuation " , but she noted that this is " just a hunch " , as she has not yet read the work . nor have i , yet ! a final response came from stavros macrakis ( macrakis @ osf . org ) with the following suggestions : " i note that there is a library of congress ( tn3270 locis . loc . gov ) heading capitalization , but most of the books there are prescriptive or educational . there is also a subheading capitalization under languages , but english language - - capitalization gives only workbooks . i found some books on german capitalization which may ( or may not ) be helpful . see below . harvard 's catalogue lists 15 books on english capitalization , all prescriptive . = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = materialien zur historischen entwicklung der gross - und kleinschreibungsregeln / wolfgang mentrup ( hg . ) . tuebingen : niemeyer , 1980 . 336 p . lc call # pf3147 . m34 subjects [ for mentrup ] : german language - - capitalization - - history . + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + moulin , claudine . der majuskelgebrauch in luthers deutschen briefen ( 1517-1546 ) . heidelberg : winter , 1990 . xxxiii , 462 pp . subjects : luther , martin german language - - capitalization german language - - orthography and spelling originally presented as author 's doctoral thesis , 1989 , in otto - friedrich - universitaet , bamberg . = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = that is all . i would like to thank everyone who replied , even if only to express an interest . it was heartening to know that other people find this a tantalizing question as well . to conclude , i would like to put forward some further questions that have occurred to me as a result of the responses i received . . . . 1 ) in connection to the point about the rise of the printing industry as an important influence in * * regularising * * the use of capitalisation , i still have questions about the way people capitalised before the printing press . for instance , in religious writings , such as the book of kells ( eire ) , we find capital letters , ornately decorated , at the start of portions of text / top of the page . why were capitals used ? i have n't seen copies of the work , but did adam bede do the same ? 2 ) building on ( 1 ) , i then ask , where / why did the idea of capitalisation arise in the first place ? in quite a number of other writing systems of the world , a method of marking " important " words with a larger , and slightly different version , of the " normal " sized letters is completely absent . thus , who / why / where did capitalisation come into being ? we take this so much for granted , i wonder if we can still re - / discover the reasoning behind this " distinctiveness " strategy . ( and as a final parting shot , so to speak , i would like to point out that in english writing we use a capital letter for the 1st . p . s . in all environments , but not for any other person ! why ? was this a printing influence too ( e . g . , to distinguish it from small " i " in roman numerals ? ) . ) from talking to a local professor , russian , for instance , ( if i remember correctly ) , does not have this distinction . how about other language writing systems , european or not ? and what effect does this english pattern have on us psychologically ? in the sense that " i " is more important than " you , them " etc . ? ) . once again , thank-you to all respondents . i look forward to discussion , if any , on my questions - - either post to list or to me directly . regards to all , anthea . * * " words do n't mean , people mean . . . .

<subject> 6 . 351 language policy </subject> frank ashen focussed on the divisive effects of promoting one of several indigenous languages to the position of official language and used the much quoted justification that speakers of not-chosen languages may feel disadvantaged . he did not mention the effect of the introduction of a foreign world language on the vernaculars . the introduction of foreign official language has , in africa , led to explicit negative attitudes amongst the speakers themselves towards their languages . the alternative to the selection of an indigenous language as official language seems to be to disadvantage the whole population . in most african countries the foreign official language generally has a very low penetration so that only the elite know it . knowledge of the official language then becomes a new factor that determines access to power and the well-paid jobs . at the same time the vernaculars are ignored or stigmatised . this means that no or very little funds are available for their development and teaching . this means , to come back to tove skutnabb - kangas ' comments , that the population cannot exercise their " right to learn their mother tongue , both orally and in writing , up to a high level . " the assumption that frank ashen quotes is based on a false departure point , namely that only a colonial language can save an african country from being torn up by its own internal divisions . i do n't recall any wars based on language differences prior to colonisation . africa solved its linguistic diversity by developing lingua francas . djit ? recently ( 1993 ) showed that the use of so-called international languages such as english and french have not solved the communication problems of the african masses but in many cases contributed towards the " pathology of linguistic bakwardness " . the fact that these languages ( such as wolof , swahili , hausa , lingala ) are actually spreading - without much official help - seems to indicate " a general willingness for cooperation and a cultural and linguistic tolerance that ignores the political boundaries inherited from colonization " djit ? ( 1993 : 162 ) . spencer ( 1985 : 395 ) claims that the introduction of european languages to africa retarded the spread of what he calls " african vehicular languages " . however , adegbija ( 1994 : 26-27 ) is sceptical of the ability of african lingua francas of being accepted outside their present geographical domains . he also warns against the imposition of these languages . it would seem that we need a three-language policy such as that of india : one language for communication with the outside world known by a relatively small section of the population ; one lingua franca for national and regional communication and the various vernaculars for local business and primary education . in many african countries this is the de facto situation and trilingualism is more common in africa than outside linguists seem to realise . this suggestion might avoid the subtractive language learning ( that characterises many african communities ) and that tove skutnabb - kangas finds " a violation of minorities ' linguistic rights " . the sources that i referred to : adegbija , e . 1994 language attitudes in africa : a sociolinguistic overview . clevedon : multilingual matters . djit ? , p . g . 1993 " language development in africa .

( 2 ) computational models and ( 3 ) symbol grounding . the target audience of this colloquium will include engineers and scientists in neural networks and artificial intelligence , developmental psychologists , cognitive scientists , philosophers of mind , biologists and all of those interested in the application of artificial intelligence to real world problems . programme : monday , may 15th , 1995 * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * introduction : 9 . 00 registration + sustenance 10 . 00 ` an introduction ' noel sharkey ( department of computer science , university of sheffield , england ) biology : 10 . 30 ` the neuronal mechanisms of language ' valentino braitenberg ( max plank institute for biological cybernetics , tuebingen , germany ) computational models : 11 . 00 ` natural language and exploration of an information space ' oliviero stock ( istituto per la ricerca scientifica e technologica , irst ) ( trento , italy ) 11 . 30 ` how visual salience influences natural language descriptions ' wolfgang maass ( cognitive science programme ) ( universitaet des saarlandes , saarbruecken , germany ) 12 . 00 discussion 12 . 30 lunch grounding symbols : 2 . 00 ` on grounding language with neural networks ' georg dorffner ( austrian institute for artificial intelligence , vienna , austria ) 2 . 30 ` some observations on symbol-grounding from a combined symbolic / connectionist viewpoint ' john barnden ( computing research laboratory , new mexico , usa ) & ( department of computer science , university of reading , england ) 3 . 00 sustenance break 3 . 30 ` grounding symbols in sensorimotor categories with neural networks ' stevan harnad ( department of psychology , university of southampton , england ) panel discussion and questions : 4 . 00 ` grounding representations ' chairs + invited speakers s / in s / in : 4 . 30 ` de brief / comments ' paul mc kevitt ( department of computer science , university of sheffield , england ) 5 . 00 o / iche mha / ith * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * publication : we intend to publish a book on this colloquium proceedings . addresses iee contact : sarah leong groups officer the institution of electrical engineers ( iee ) savoy place gb - wc2r obl , london england , uk , eu . e - mail : sleong @ iee . org . uk ( sarah leong ) e - mail : mbarrett @ iee . org . uk ( martin barrett ) e - mail : dpenrose @ iee . org . uk ( david penrose ) www : http : / / www . iee . org . uk ftp : ftp . iee . org . uk fax : + 44 ( 0 ) 171-497 - 3633 phone : + 44 ( 0 ) 171-240 - 1871 ( general ) phone : + 44 ( 0 ) 171-344 - 8423 ( direct ) location : the institution of electrical engineers ( iee ) savoy place gb - wc2r obl , london england , uk , eu . academic contact : paul mc kevitt department of computer science regent court 211 portobello street university of sheffield gb - s1 4dp , sheffield england , uk , eu . e - mail : p . mckevitt @ dcs . shef . ac . uk www : http : / / www . dcs . shef . ac . uk / www : http : / / www . shef . ac . uk / ftp : ftp . dcs . shef . ac . uk fax : + 44 ( 0 ) 114-278 - 0972 phone : + 44 ( 0 ) 114-282 - 5572 ( office ) 282-5596 ( lab . ) 282-5590 ( secretary ) registration : registration forms are available from sarah leong at the above address and should be sent to the following address : ( it is not possible to register by e - mail . ) colloquium bookings institution of electrical engineers ( iee ) po box 96 stevenage gb - sg1 2sd herts england , uk , eu . fax : + 44 ( 0 ) 143 874 2792 receipt enquiries : + 44 ( 0 ) 143 876 7243 registration enquiries : + 44 ( 0 ) 171 240 1871 x . 2206 pre-registration is advised although you can register on the day of the event . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ r e g i s t r a t i o n costs _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ( all figures include vat ) iee members 44 . 00 non-iee members 74 . 00 iee members ( retired , unemployed , students ) free non-iee members ( retired , unemployed , students ) 22 . 00 lunch ticket 4 . 70 members : members of the ieeie , the british computer society and the society for the study of artificial intelligence and simulation of behaviour and eurel member associations will be admitted at members ' rates .
<subject> latex on pc 's </subject> last month i posted a query about latex on pcs . here 's a summary of the responses i got and my own experience in making my choice ( gtex ) work ( if you plan to adopt gtex , especially for windows nt , be sure to read my comments - - it will save you time . . . ) first , i 'd like to thank the following persons for proving , yet again , the power of the virtual community : alderson @ netcom . com ( richard m . alderson iii ) mark robert hale ( hale1 @ alcor . concordia . ca ) michael covington ( mcovingt @ ai . uga . edu ) stewart nichols ( nichols @ ccwf . cc . utexas . edu ) knappen @ vkpmzd . kph . uni - mainz . de ( j " org knappen ) sl70 @ musuko . spc . uchicago . edu ( stuart luppescu ) achim @ chianti . philosophie . uni-stuttgart . de ( achim stein ) terdoest @ cs . utwente . nl ( hugo ter doest ) wilhelm weisweber ( ww @ cs . tu-berlin . de ) alex schoenmakers ( alex . schoenmakers @ ccl . kuleuven . ac . be ) peter - arno coppen ( u250005 @ vm . uci . kun . nl ) koontz @ alpha . bldr . nist . gov ( john e . koontz ) syang @ uvvm . uvic . ca ( suying yang ) robert dale ( rdale @ microsoft . com ) alfredo arnaiz ( arnaiz @ scf . usc . edu ) c . l . thiersch @ kub . nl ( craig thiersch ) alice drewery ( alice @ cogsci . edinburgh . ac . uk ) all the messages were extremly helpful . they provided fairly detailed information and many offered further help if i needed it . thanks ! i have divided the information into the following categories : 1 . general tex info 2 . the unix option 3 . the commercial option 4 . the mac option 5 . emtex 6 . gtex ( including my own experience in installing and using it ) hope it is useful for others as well . ami kronfeld natural language inc . 1 ) general tex info - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - " you might want to check out the usenet group comp . tex . tex , and its faq . also , the book mking tex work , by norman walsh , from o'reilly associates . " " you can also check out the tex archives on the us ctan site : ftp . shsu . edu . " " the most comprehensive distribution is called 4alltex , it 's available at the standard ctan - archive sites ( like ftp . shsu . edu ) and on the cd - rom " snapshot " of same from prime time ( prime time texcetera ) . " special thanks to suying yang who sent a very useful page from walsh 's _ making tex work _ . here it is : tex and the other programs mentioned in this book are available from a number of places . it 's impossible to list all of the places where you might find any given tool , but there is one place where you will almost certainly find every tool : the comprehensive tex archive network ( ctan ) . this network is a fully-mirrored anonymous ftp hierarchy on three continents . always use the ftp site that is geographically closest to you . the following table lists the current members of ctan as of july 1993 : % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % location site ip address top level directory united states ftp . shsu . edu 192 . 92 . 115 . 10 / tex-archive england ftp . tex . ac . uk 131 . 151 . 79 . 32 / tex-archive germany ftp . uni-stuugart . de 129 . 69 . 8 . 13 / tex-archive % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % you may also access the ctan archives by electronic mail if you do not have ftp access . for up-to - date instructions about the mail server , send the single-line message help to : fileserv @ shsu . edu . where are the files ? every ctan mirror site has the same well-organized directory structure . the top-level directory also contains a complete catalog of current files organized by name , date , and size . the catalogs are named files . byname , files . bydate , and files . bysize , respectively , in the top level directory . the top-level directory contains the following subdirectories : % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % directory description of contents tools archiving tools ( unzip , tar , compress , etc . ) biblio tools for maintaining bibliographic databases digests electronic digests ( texhax , uktex , etc . ) info free documentation , many good guides dviware printing and previewing software fonts fonts fo tex graphics software for working with pictures and figures help online help files , etc . indexing indexing and glossary building tools language multi - national language support macros macro packages and stule files misc stuff that does n't fit in any other category support tools for running and supporting tex systems os - specific programs and files web sources for tex programs ( in web ) % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % the archives at ftp . shsu . edu and ftp . tex . ac . uk also support gopher access to the archives . the uk gopher supports indexed access to the archives . a world wide web ( hypertext ) interface to the archives is available from : http : / / jasper . ora . com / ctan / ctan . html this interface includes brief descriptions of many packages and the ability to perform keyword and date searches . 2 ) the unix option : - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - many have pointed out that i could run linux ( freely distributed unix clone ) on my pc , and that it has great tex support ( ntex 1 . 3 ) . this turned out to be impractical for me . but it is an option i did not know existed : " check out freebsd , freely downloadable from ftp . freebsd . org , or available as a cdrom from cdrom . com ( about $ 40 or less ) . you can maintain dos and unix on the same hardware and switch between the two , and therefore have your latex , too . " 3 ) the commercial option : - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - " there is a commercial version of ( la ) tex available for pcs from y&y , who just today have announced a sales-help @ yandy . com ( among other addresses ) .

" for info on truetex email richard j . kinch ( kinch @ netcom . com ) ; for info on y&y tex email louis vosloo ( 71172 . 524 @ compuserve . com ) . both are in the $ 400 - - 500 area from memory . seemed to me that y&y tex was a bit more abreast of changes ( like latex 2e ) than truetex but you 'd be best to get info from both of course to make up your own mind . " 4 ) latex on the mac - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - " if you are not set on an intel - based processor , oztex 1 . 8 is the best shareware version for the mac , while textures ( from blue sky ) is a highly regarded commercial implementation . " " i ' ve used textures for years on a mac and still have n't seen anything to compare in terms of ease of integration of graphics . " 5 ) emtex - - - - - - - - - emtex seems to be the overall favorite for dos machines . it is said to be much more widely used ( than gtex ) and easier to install . a summary of how you can get it : " the most painless way to get latex on your pc is to download emtex from the university of georgia ( ai . uga . edu , / pub / emtex ) . we give additional installation instructions besides those provided by the author . " other cites : ftp . rus . uni-stuttgart . de / pub / tex / sytems / msdos / emtex and emtex-fonts ponder . csci . unt . edu [ 129 . 120 . 3 . 16 ] pub / tex / emtex ymir . claremont . edu [ 134 . 173 . 4 . 23 ] [ anonymous . tex . ibm _ pc . emtex ] there was also a particular enthusiastic endorsment of emtex for emacs users on os / 2 : " i use the os / 2 version [ of emtex ] which is truly excellent ( not being limited by memory , it is much better than the dos version ) . there are also available for os / 2 , a graphical dvi viewer ( dvipm ) , ghostscript , dvips , etc . in addition , em has ported gnu emacs to os / 2 ( the current version is 19 . 27 ) . imho , if you are going to work in latex , you should be using emacs in latex mode as your editor . emacs + emtex under os / 2 has pretty much supplanted other use of word processing software " 6 ) gtex - - - - - - - - the gtex package was said to be more complete ( amslatex , amstex , dviwin etc . ) and more windows - friendly than emtex . this is , more or less , what sold me on it . i got it from : gtex ftp . shsu . edu / tex-archive / systems / msdos / gtex1 . 0 for ms windows / dos users . microemacs for windows is the host interface whose menus allow easy access to tex / metafont / amspell / bibtex / etc . also included are complete macro sets for plain tex , latex , nfss , e - tex , amslatex , and amstex . one person who responded to my query commented that gtex is less mature than emtex . i must say that he is probably right . installation took me much longer than i anticipated . here is a summary of the problems and their workarounds : 1 ) to begin with , the main tex . exe in the base directory does not accept arguments . i may have missed something , but i could not make latex work by the standard $ ) tex &lplain ( file-name > what i got was simply the tex environment . i could , of course , load lplain at this point and then load my file . but this is rather cumbersome . i found a workaround through micro-emacs , which is part of the package . 2 ) i did n't realize that if you unzip latex2e after unzipping latex , you clobber some of the latex 2 . 09 . sty files ( and you cannot use latex 2 . 09 as a result ) . there is a ( rather complex ) workaround and if you need latex2e only to begin with you are in good shape . however , it turned out that when you run latex2e . bat in the texfmts directory ( to generate the . fmt file for latex2e ) the name of the fmt file is latex . fmt , but it turned out that micro-emacs package expects a totally different fmt file for latex2e , namely a file called nfss2ltx . fmt . even changing the relevant bat file does not solve the problem . the only workaround i could find was to copy latex . fmt as nfss2ltx . fmt ( in short , if you do n't want the hassle , install latex only ) . 3 ) the dviwin package for both previewing and printing ( written by hipocrates sendoukas ) is rather nice . the feature that generates missing fonts automatically is particularly useful if your disk space is limited . however setting this option to work right was difficult and the documentation is not very helpful . if you run under windows nt ( as i do ) this is what you need to do : o select options / missing fonts . . . o select the third option ( append line to file and execute command ) o in the line text box write : call genpk $ f $ m $ x $ y $ x $ y $ d $ p $ e o in the file text box write : x : \ ( temp-dir ) \ < batch-file . bat > where x : is your hard drive , temp-dir is the value of your temp environment variable and batch-file is an arbitrary name for a batch file that will generatte missing fonts . for example , i use the following text : c : \ temp \ missing . bat o in the cmd text box write : genallnt . bat $ ( temp ) \ missing . bat where temp is the environment variable that contains the name of the directory in the file text box . note that in the cmd text box you need to use an environment variable ( you have to ) while in the file text box you cannot ( you must specify the literal name of the temp directory ) . it took me a while to figure this out and it was n't fun . if you do it wrong , dviwin takes control over your entire operating system , firing up and killing dos widows in rapid succession . you cannot even use nt 's task list to kill the runaway process .
<subject> foreign language in ads </subject> sorry to be delayed in getting a summary back on the foreign language in the recent ibm ads . as usual , lots of linguist list readers came through with the goods . ( individual thanks are at the end of this message ) . here are the responses i received : the old gentlemen walking along the river are speaking french ( there was some disagreement as to whether it was parisian french or not , with people coming down on both sides ) ; the businessmen in the marketplace are speaking moroccan arabic ; the majority opinion was that the nuns are speaking czech ( though a couple of people felt it was polish ) . i ' ve seen one ad since then which i ' m pretty sure is in greek ( people on a fishing boat ) , because one of the subtitles contains mention of drachmas . if i ' m wrong about that , i 'd like to know , needless to say . those of you who expressed interest in seeing some of our research , i have n't forgotten you ! i ' ve just been buried in administrative stuff lately . i ' ll try to do something about getting it off over spring break , which is in a couple of weeks . if you do n't see something in the next few weeks , you might want to drop me another line at renryder @ idbsu . idbsu . edu . finally , very hearfelt thanks to everyone who wrote ( i hope i have n't left anyone off this list ) : eva wyss , daniel keller , marc picard , laila lalami , john koontz , dana slancova , gary h . toops , marlene abrams miller , guerssel mohamed , frits stuurman , chris miller , greenman , younes mourchid , tim beasley , james kirchner , paul woods , jussi karlgren , marc eisinger , michael kac , rebecca larche moreton , carl woolhiser , anton sherwood , elabbas benmamoun , karin ryding , elizabeth bergman , kirk belnap ( ? ) , reinier post . if anyone wants the addresses of any of these people to discuss the language id with them further , i have them ; i just did n't want to make this message any longer than necessary . thanks to everyone ! mary ellen ryder
<subject> sum : jakobson reference </subject> two months ago ( sorry for the delay ) i posted the following query on the linguist list ( with a horrible spelling error in the subject line ) : ) the following is , i believe , a more or less literal quote from roman jakobson : ) languages differ less in what you can express in them than in what you must ) > express in them . ) does anybody out there have the exact reference ? 1 . reaction to the query = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = six hours later it appeared on the list and three more hours later the first answer was in ! ! ! thank you all , that 's really great ! ! ! within the following four weeks i received ten replies , 5 of them giving the first quotation below , 2 with the second one , 3 asking me to forward the requested information . thanks to all who responded : birgitta englund dimitrova bob fradkin eloise jelinek hans lindquist nili mandelblit bruce mannheim bert peeters larry rosenwald deborah ruuskanen martha thunes 2 . answers = = = = = = = = = = a . the first quotation is : jakobson , roman ( 1959 ) ' on linguistic aspects of translation ' in reuben a . brower ( ed . ) , on translation , cambridge , mass . : harvard university , press . 232-239 . reprint new york : galaxy books 1966 . the quoted sentence is on p . 236 . also in jakobson , roman ( 1971 ) selected writings vol . ii , the hague : mouton . 260-266 . the quoted sentence is here on p . 264 . ( birgitta englund dimitrova mentions that this article has ever since been widely quoted in research on translation . ) the context is the division of labor between lexical and grammatical means , which may vary considerably from language to language , and the problems this poses for translation : " if some grammatical category is absent in a given language , its meaning may be translated into this language by lexical means . . . . it is more difficult to remain faithful to the original when we translate into a language provided with a certain grammatical category from a language devoid of such a category . . . . as boas neatly observed , the grammatical pattern of a language ( as opposed to its lexical stock ) determines those aspects of each experience that must be expressed in the given language . . . . in order to translate accurately the english sentence " i hired a worker , " a russian needs supplementary information , whether this action was completed or not and whether the worker was a man or a woman . . . ) languages differ essentially in what they _ must _ convey and not in what they ) > _ may _ convey . each verb of a given language imperatively raises a set of specific yes-no - questions . . . " b . the second quotation is : jakobson , roman ( 1959 ) ' boas ' view of grammatical meaning ' in w . goldschmidt ( ed . ) , the anthropology of franz boas , memoirs of the american anthropological association 89 . 139-45 . reprinted in jakobson , roman ( 1971 ) selected writings vol . ii , the hague : mouton . 489-496 . the quoted sentence is on p . 492 . here the context is boas ' obligatoriness criterion for the distinction between grammatical and lexical meaning . jakobson quotes from boas : " . . . ' a paucity of obligatory aspects does not by any means imply obscurity of speech . when necessary , clarity can be obtained by adding explanatory words . ' to denote time or plurality , those languages which have no tense or grammatical number resort to lexical means . ) thus the true difference between languages is not in what may or may not be ) > expressed but in what must or must not be conveyed by the speakers . " ( am i right as a non-native speaker of english in suspecting that my fellow non-native speaker has possibly confounded ' must not ' with ' need not ' ? ) 3 . motivation for the query = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = i am using the ( first ) quote in a typological context , as motto for a paper where i discuss some of the consequences the obligatoriness of definiteness and number marking has for those cases of use where the speaker wants to evade these constraints . i argue there that languages with a high degree of explicitness ( many obligatory choices ) also provide for standard weakening strategies . if any typologist out there wants to engage in a discussion about the explicitness parameter , i would be happy to hear from him . to trigger the appropriate keywords , let me just mention that james huang 's ' temperature ' parameter ( the metaphor goes back , via haj ross , to marshall mcluhan ) is just a special case of the explicitness parameter . according to huang ( li 15 , 1984 , pp . 531-574 ) , languages with a high degree of obligatoriness in the expression of anaphoric elements are ' hot ' ( little audience participation required ) , whereas languages with a preference for zero anaphora are ' cool ' ( more audience participation required ) . let me conclude with another quote from the first paper of rj : " equivalence in difference is the cardinal problem of language and the pivotal concern of linguistics .

<subject> est-ce que questions </subject> several weeks ago , i ' ve sent an inquiry about is it that / est-ce que interrogatives to the list . many of you took the time to answer to it , so i feel very sorry for not giving any summary of the replies before today . i have written one in french , which i display here . if some of you would like a translation , please ask and i ' ll write one . thanks again for your precious collaboration ! the inquiry was : j ' ai rencontre l ' enonce authentique suivant : why is it that ( people are never happy ) ? qui ressemble beaucoup au fran ais : pourquoi est-ce que ( les gens ne sont jamais contents ) ? j ' aimerais savoir s ' il est possible de poser une question de la meme maniere avec : what , who , when , where or how ? what is it that you said / are saying ? who is it that you met / are meeting ? when is it that you met / are meeting her ? how is it that you did / do this ? where is it that you were / are ? sur les 54 reponses obtenues , 21 consistent en une phrase : " tous ces exemples me paraissent acceptables et normaux " . les auteurs des autres reponses ont tres majoritairement accepte tous les exemples egalement , mais avec quelques restrictions d ' emploi que nous developpons ici . les quatre grands types de restrictions sont le registre de langue employe , la semantique de l ' interrogative , la nature de l ' adverbe interrogatif et le temps du verbe etre place avant ' it that ' . 1 . le registre employe est juge pertinent pour l ' acceptabilite de la structure , comme le montrent les six remarques suivantes : " alors que les phrases proposees seraient appropriees dans un registre tres formel , des equivalents plus courants [ colloquial ] seraient : you said / are saying whatj ? you met / are meeting whoj ? you met / are meeting her whenj ? you did / do this howj ? you were / are where j ? cet equivalent ' courant ' n ' existe pas cependant avec why . je dirais plutot : people never seem to be happy . why ( is that ) j ? " " why is it that convient mais ne semble pas tres naturel ; l ' emploi de ' that ' marque un registre plus formel . " " les exemples semblent appropries dans tous les registres , peut-etre un peu moins frequents dans un ecrit tres formel . " " toutes ces questions sont parfaitement ordinaires . " " j ' attribue ces phrases au registre courant [ colloquial ] plutot que litteraire . " " je dirais que ces phrases seraient acceptees par n ' importe quel locuteur americanophone , au moins dans une conversation informelle . " les commentaires divergent , certains locuteurs attribuant les exemples a un registre formel , d ' autres a un registre non formel . la premiere personne optant pour le registre formel precise que ce type d ' enonce est caracteristique d ' une question que poserait par exemple un avocat au cours d ' un proces ; mais c ' est peut-etre plutot la semantique de la question qui importe ici , et non le registre . la deuxieme personne ayant choisi le registre formel semble cependant s ' appuyer surtout sur la presence de that . en effet , une autre reponse souligne la difference existant entre les formes ' why is it ' et ' why is it that ' . par consequent nous pouvons retenir des commentaires obtenus que la construction qui nous interesse releve globalement d ' un registre courant - voire familier - mais peut se retrouver dans d ' autres registres sous certaines formes ( avec that vs sans that ) et pour exprimer certains actes de parole . 2 . la semantique de l ' interrogative intervient elle aussi dans le choix de cette construction , comme l ' attestent les 13 remarques suivantes : " par rapport a la construction plus traditionnelle , celle-ci se limite aux cas ou le locuteur exprime une repetition ou une clarification apres avoir pose la question sous la forme plus courante : me : what did you sayj ? you : i said " goodbye and good riddancej ! " me : what is it that you saidj ? i was n't listening closely . " " cette construction marquee n ' est appropriee que si le discours precedent a deja etabli qu ' il y aura une reponse non negative a la question . ainsi , l ' echange suivant ne semblerait pas naturel : - who is it that you sawj ? - nobody . " " je n ' accepterais pas ou reagirais negativement a la phrase how is it that you did thatj ? . j ' emploie cette construction avec tous les autres adverbes ( where , who , what , when ) pour obtenir un eclaircissement a propos d ' une chose deja mentionnee . " " les exemples me semblent normaux si le locuteur met l ' accent sur l ' adverbe interrogatif et exprime une certaine exasperation : what is that thing you boughtj ? " " ces questions sont tout a fait acceptables , moyennant un contexte discursif particulier du type reprise . d ' ou la meilleure acceptabilite des versions dans lesquelles le verbe est marque de l ' aspect be + ing ( fondamentalement anaphorique ) . " " cette construction met l ' emphase sur l ' element interrogatif . " " spontanement , je dirais que cette construction se focalise sur la question plus specifiquement . si l ' on me demandait : who are you meetingj ? je pourrais repondre : a friend . mais si la question etait : who is it that you ' re meetingj ? je me sentirais oblige de repondre plus precisement . " " la seule raison justifiant l ' emploi de cette construction est , a mon avis , l ' emphase qu ' elle met sur l ' objet de la question . " " en anglais , ces questions sont posees de fa on rhetorique ou pour exprimer une demande de clarification . dans le deuxieme cas , l ' element interrogatif est fortement accentue . " " la plupart de ces questions ressemblent a une demande de repetition de quelque chose qui aurait ete mal compris a la premiere audition . " " les questions de ce type correspondent a la forme declarative emphatique it is because of x that ou it is x that i am saying ( . . . ) . ces questions en anglais se traduiraient mieux en fran ais par quelque chose comme : qui c ' est que tu as vuj ? qui met aussi l ' accent sur la reponse la ou une question en est-ce que normale ne le ferait pas . cette construction entra ne aussi une accentuation plus forte sur l ' element interrogatif . " " dans beaucoup de cas , ces formes marqueraient une emphase utilisee par exemple si je pensais avoir mal compris un message : where is it that you [ said you ] arej ? " " pour moi , ces constructions presupposent que quelqu ' un vous a donne l ' information ( what , who , when ou where ) et que vous l ' avez oubliee et devez poser une question sur ce seul element . " toutes ces remarques s ' accordent pour attribuer a la construction qui nous interesse un sens emphatique utilise pour obtenir une clarification . elle semble aussi s ' accompagner d ' une accentuation de l ' element interrogatif . il est donc interessant de remarquer que la valeur emphatique est commune aux constructions anglaise et fran aise . 3 . parmi les 54 reponses , 11 tentaient d ' expliquer partiellement ou completement la variation de l ' acceptabilite de la construction en fonction de la nature de l ' adverbe interrogatif : " where is it that you arej ? et how is it that you do thisj ? sont pour moi les constructions les plus maladroites et les moins frequentes . " " where is it that you arej ? est maladroit ; je repeterais probablement la question where are youj ? en accentuant plus le where . " " je ne pense pas que le that dans why is it that soit le meme que dans les constructions avec les adverbes interrogatifs . " " why is it et how is it sont toujours idiomatiques , meme s ' ils sont plutot formels . when is it est idiomatique , mais para t assez pauvre . les autres enonces identifieraient a coup sur le locuteur comme etant etranger . " " toutes ces constructions sont possibles , excepte celle avec how . " " pour what , who , when et where , je peux employer is it seulement avec le present ; avec le passe je dirais was it . pour how c ' est different parce que how is it est une forme idiomatique signifiant pourquoi pour moi . donc how is it that you did thisj ? convient si cela signifie pourquoi as-tu fait celaj ? . si je veux vraiment savoir comment , alors le temps doit correspondre comme avec les autres adverbes interrogatifs . " " les constructions avec what , who et when sont acceptables , mais celles avec how et where ne semblent pas tres naturelles . " " toutes les constructions me conviennent ( sauf peut-etre la derniere avec where , qui me para t bizarre ) . " " je pense qu ' il ne serait pas approprie d ' employer is it that dans aucune des situations mentionnees , excepte why is it that . . " " j ' utiliserais cette construction avec when seulement s ' il etait suivi de was it ; je ne l ' emploierais pas avec how et where . " " tous les exemples cites sont acceptables mais , mise a part la question avec why ( et peut-etre celle avec how ) , ils ne semblent pas aussi generaux que la question ordinaire [ unmarked ] . " pour des raisons qui leur sont probablement propres , why , how et where se distinguent des autres adverbes . how is it peut s ' interpreter a la fois comme une forme figee qui a le sens de pourquoi ( = how come ) , et comme une construction non figee signifiant comment . . cela explique les differences de perception de cette forme par les locuteurs , qui n ' ont pas toujours pris en compte ses deux sens . why is it a egalement un comportement de forme figee , mais qui garde le sens de pourquoi . pourquoi est aussi un adverbe qui se demarque des autres en fran ais , car la question qu ' il pose porte sur l ' ensemble de la phrase ( pourquoi tu t ' en vasj ? mais * tu t ' en vas pourquoij ? ) . nous expliquons moins facilement la specificite de where qui a ete relevee a 5 reprises . 4 . le dernier facteur d ' acceptabilite egalement souvent cite ( huit fois ) par les natifs est le temps du verbe etre place avant it that . : " toutes ces phrases s ' emploient couramment en anglais . a noter qu ' on peut aussi bien utiliser ce genre de structure au passe : where was it that you ran into him yesterdayj ? " " nous formons souvent des enonces come ceux que vous citez , par exemple : who was it who split ink on your book ? why was it that he was late ? who did we say was coming at 8 o ' clock ? etc . " " pour what , who , when et where , je peux employer is it seulement avec le present ; avec le passe je dirais was it . [ pour ] how is it that you did thisj ? , et si je veux vraiment savoir comment , alors le temps doit correspondre comme avec les autres adverbes interrogatifs . " " toutes les phrases me conviennent , meme si dans plusieurs cas j ' ai pense qu ' il y avait une meilleure alternative : what is it that you said / are saying ? ) aussi : what was it that you said ? who is it that you met / are meeting ? ) aussi : who was it that you met ? when is it that you met / are meeting her ? ) avec " met " , " when was it that you met " est meilleur . how is it that you did / do this ? ) aussi : how was it that you did that ? where is it that you were / are ? ) avec " were " , " where was it that you were " est meilleur . " " toutes les phrases sont bonnes . elles seraient un peu meilleures si les temps des verbes s ' accordaient . " " les questions conviennent toutes , tant que le temps employe est correct . " " quand l ' anglais emploie l ' expression is it that , les temps des verbes doivent correspondre dans la plupart des cas . " " toutes les phrases sont parfaitement correctes , sauf que normalement j ' accorderais le temps du premier verbe a celui du second lorsque deuxieme la portion de la phrase est au passe . par exemple : who was it that you met ? ( but ) who is it that you are meeting ? when was it that you met her ? ( but ) when is it that you are meeting her ? . " nous pouvons sur ce point differencier les constructions ' is it that ' et ' est-ce que ' , la construction de l ' anglais etant beaucoup moins figee que celle du fran ais . en effet , le fran ais n ' accorderait pas les temps des deux verbes .

<subject> summary : expletive negation in modern hebrew </subject> on february 27 , i posted a querry on expletive negation in modern hebrew . i want to thank ariel cohen ( ariel _ cohen @ riga . mt . cs . cmu . edu ) , michael ephratt ( rhlh702 @ uvm . haifa . ac . il ) , bob fradkin ( raf100f @ oduvm . cc . odu . edu ) , laurence horn ( lhorn @ yalevm . cis . yale . edu ) , paul rowlett ( p . a . rowlett @ mod - lang . salford . ac . uk ) and lucia tovena ( tovena @ latl . unige . ch ) for their comments . my querry originated from michael moore 's comment to the effect that in modern hebrew , the sentence negation of subordinate clauses dominated by before , until and i ' m afraid can be interpreted referentially or expletively . according to ariel cohen , only until contexts allow an expletive negation . bob fradkin mentionned that expletive negation in mh seemed less frequent than in french . while it seems that expletive negation in mh has a narrower domain of use than in french , there might also be a question of style involved here ; while expletive negation is an aknowledged grammatical feature of formal style in french , it might be a non-standard feature of mh . this is suggested to me by the fact that neither glinert 1989 suggested by michael ephratt nor rosen 1977 even mention expletive negation in mh . lucia tovena pointed me to her 1994 paper in geneva generative papers about italian , hungarian and hindi expletive negation in until contexts . for a typological overview of expletive negation , one can consult horn 1978 , which shows the typological extension of the phenomenon . now , i ' m still left with a few unanswered questions . i ' m surprised that there apparently does n't exist any study on the topic in mh . i wonder whether i should be looking in the direction of ancient hebrew . a question of more general interest is how to deal with divergent distributions of a phenomenon across languages ; in other words , how should the fact that expletive negation exists in comparative and fearing contexts in a large number of languages but not in mh ? ? could matters of style , as suggested above , explain this ? ? thanks for those who responded and for those who will . - glinert , l . , 1989 , the grammar of modern hebrew , cambridge up . - horn , l . , 1978 , some aspects of negation , j . greenberg , universals of human language , vol . 4 , standford up , 127-210 . - moore , m . , 1992 , double negation , et cetera , 304-309 . - rosen , 1977 , contemporary hebrew . pierre larrivee departement de langues et linguistique , universite laval , quebec , canada , g1k 7p4 3914larp @ vm1 . ulaval . ca

<subject> materials to learn luganda </subject> i ' m inquiring for a somewhat linguistically savvy undergraduate who will be spending this june - november in kampala : what is there available in the way of books , a / v materials , courses , whatever for learning luganda ? thanks . george huttar huttar @ sil . org
<subject> queries </subject> in a reference i can no longer identify , i recall coming across an assertion that the accent with which east indians speak english arose as a result of the teachers of english in india during the major period of british colonialism there were from wales . as a result , indians were originally taught english with a welsh accent , a happenstance of linguistic accidnet perpetuated through succeeding generations . is ther any truth to this ? does anyone out there know the origins of this ? further - - are there any studies on characteristics of national accents in foreign tongues ( eg . is there a relationship between the characteristic accent with which italians speak english and , say , the way in which they might speak russian ; or the english person 's accent in speaking spanish or in speaking french , for instance ) . finally - - a medico-linguistic query . in older medical text - books which listening to the chest with a stethoscope , the physician is instructed to tell the patient to enunciate " ninety-nine . " this actually makes very little sense . the origin apparently is from an early translation from the german in which the german term-equivalent used in the original text for what was translated as " ninety-nine " does involve strong expirations and so is a useful tool in examination . again - - does anyone out there have any info on this ? to complicate things further - - i am a biologist and not a linguist and am not on this list ! so i would greatly apprciate it you could communicate with me directly : shodell @ aurora . liunet . edu very many thanks for reading this far and for any help you might be able to offer - - mike shodell
<subject> the ipa market </subject> " alexis mr " urges that phonetic alphabets be standardized , and writes , " why not let the invisible hand of the " market " of ideas operate freely ? " but the market * is * operating . that 's exactly why we have several different systems , any that 's why people feel free to modify those systems as they please . i do not see how the market would demand i asked in an earlier egram ( vol-6 - 199 ) why it would benefit me , as an active fieldworker , to have a completely revamped phonetic alphabet . i am still waiting for a plausible answer . i am happy with ipa most of the time , and when i ' m not i innovate as necessary . a complete overhaul would be wrenching for me and probably leave me feeling extremely alientated . more likely , i would just go on using the ipa and chinese ipa symbols i already use , and the dubious goal of a new , unified standard phonetic system would fail . i think the real reason some people want to overhaul ipa is to alter its aesthetics - to make it neater , more symmetrical somehow . i do not see any practical value in this . nor do i see any need to have a single , unified system , replacing both ipa and american consensual practice . everybody recognizes esh , and everybody recognizes s-hachek , and if a letter _ y _ appears in a transcription you look carefully at the introduction and find out what it represents , that 's all . where is the problem ? please , someone tell me , where is the problem ? david prager branner , yuen ren society asian l&l , do-21 , university of washington seattle , wa 98195 ( charmii @ u . washington . edu )
<subject> re : 6 . 389 sum : history of capitalisation in english </subject> i believe that at one time all nouns were capped in english as they still are in german . you may find something of interest in my paper on the capping of ethnic names in the just published centennial usage studies , pads . as i recall , nunberg tries to map out a descriptive theory of punctuation and says little if anything about caps ( almost no one says anything about them but there are a few works reference in th bibliography to my article . bob wachal
<subject> re : 6 . 389 sum : history of capitalisation in english </subject> just a quick one before everyone else gets in . two germanic languages , at least , dutch and standard german , use a captalised pronoun form for the polite second - person use : ' u ' in dutch , ' sie ' in german . i guess the explanation for this is respect , just as pronominal references to the deity are capitalised by many . in modern netherlands dutch , this is disappearing , and ' u ' is used , whereas in belgian dutch ( flemish ) , i have the impression it 's retained much more ( as is the use of ' u ' itself - in netherlands dutch , i believe that ' u ' is beginning to be restricted to formal , rather than merely polite , usage , whereas in belgium , people use ' u ' with each other for much longer - i even heard my children calling their friends , aged around 10 , ' u ' , and they ' re not notably polite ) . the explanation for capitalised ' i ' in english can't be respect - i suspect it 's merely typographical , having to do with the fact that lower-case ' i ' is so small . paul werth
<subject> affricates - - one segment or two </subject> the recent query and summary by larry trask on german affricates makes me think of the fact that , unless i am mistaken , it is perfectly easy to hear the difference between one - and two-segment stop-fricative sequences at least in some cases . polish has a contrast of this sort at least in initial position , where the words spelled _ trzy _ and _ czy _ differ only in that the former has a cluster , the second an affricate . also , if you compare the english way of saying _ ts _ with the german way of saying _ z _ ( or the polish or the yiddish , etc . ) , there is an audible difference . most english speakers ' rendition of _ matzah _ ( or _ matzoh _ ) for example sounds quite different from the yiddish or polish , but ( and this is also very suggestive ) i have found a few am . engl . speakers ( not all of them jewish , by the way ) who have the affricate , i . e . , one-segment / ts / in this and perhaps some other yiddish borrowings but the two segment / t / + / s / otherwise , so that these speakers do not rhyme _ matzah _ and _ lots o ( f ) _ , whereas most speakers do . finally , i think some speakers have a one-segment / ts / in hit ya , but a two-segment / t / + / s / in hits ya , although most speakers i have asked refuse to admit anything but the nonpalatalized , non-affricated pronunciation in the second case . alexis mr

<subject> query : chinese grammatical markers </subject> i ' m interested in any information regarding the diachronic development of the following grammatical markers in various chinese languages ( apologies for the email-mutilated transcriptions ) : ( 1 ) mandarin : [ de ] ( the " genitive " / " relative " marker ) ( 2 ) mandarin : [ ge ] ( the general numeral classifier ) ( 3 ) shanghainese : [ ge ] ( the " genitive " / " relative " marker ) ( 4 ) hokkien : [ e ] ( a ) ( the " genitive " / " relative " marker ) ( b ) ( the general numeral classifier ) ( 5 ) teochew : [ kai ] ( a ) ( the " genitive " / " relative " marker ) ( b ) ( the general numeral classifier ) ( 6 ) cantonese : [ ge ] ( the " genitive " / " relative " marker ) [ go ] ( the general numeral classifier ) [ dik ] ( the ligature ) more specifically : question 1 : which of the above markers are historically / etymologically related to which others , ie . deriving from a diachronically reconstructable common source ? ( eg . are mandarin [ de ] and cantonese [ dik ] diachronically related ? , etc . etc . ) question 2 : ( specific to hokkien and teochew ) most native speakers of hokkien and teochew , who are also speakers of mandarin , are of the opinion that there are two distinct markers exhibiting accidental homophony : a " genitive " / " relative " [ e ] / [ kai ] corresponding to mandarin [ de ] , and a " classifier " [ e ] / [ kai ] corresponding to mandarin [ ge ] . question 2a : is it demonstrably the case that [ e ] and [ kai ] are the respective products of diachronic coalescence of distinct forms at some earlier stage of the language ? question 2b : are there any valid synchronic arguments for positing two distinct lexical items , ie . two [ e ] 's in hokkien , and two [ kai ] 's in teochew ? ( i consider the choice of characters conventionally used to represent these markers as irrelevant . ) note : i am a general linguist , not a sinologist , and i do n't read or speak chinese . i would greatly appreciate either your own views on the above questions , or references to published works addressing these questions . however , if the references happen to be in chinese , i would be extremely grateful if you could provide a synopsis of their contents . thanks , david gil national university of singapore ellgild @ nusvm . bitnet

<subject> linguist nameserver </subject> the linguists nameserver - plea as many of you will know we maintain a nameserver for linguists and related scientists at linguist @ alf . let . uva . nl . this nameserver contains around 7500 e-mail addresses of persons and institutions , as well as institutional fax addresses . as with all such lists the addresses rapidly become out of date , as people change jobs , or computer centres change computers . to reduce the number of ghost adddresses , and add linguists to the list whose e-mail addresses are not presently contained in it , i would encourage all direct and indirect subscribers to linguist to check that their address ( es ) are still valid . three commands are relevant in this context : list this command enables one or more addresses to be extracted from the database . the correct syntax to extract bill clinton 's address ( just an example ) would be : list clinton this command should be sent to linguists @ alf . let . uva . nl remove this command enables a single address to be removed . the correct syntax is : remove clinton , bill : clinton @ ovalroom . whitehouse . gov add this command enables a single address to be added . the correct syntax is : add clinton , bill : clinton @ ovalroom . whitehouse . gov to change an address you require both a remove and an add operation . any combination of commands is acceptible as long each is given on a separate line . there is no restriction to one command per message . so 150 separate add commands in one message is quite acceptible . we would ask that people do not use capital letters in addresses - these are never essential . the reason for us to ask this at the present is that we will be transferring operations in the near future from the vax on which linguists is now maintained to a new unix system . this will also enable us to improve our service with new possibilities . norval smith pieter masereeuw

<subject> re : 6 . 381 words that are their own opposites </subject> several people submitted " overlook " and " oversight " , which are fine examples of this phenomenon in english ( though i think that mary neff 's " outgoing : retiring " is perhaps the most elegant submission to date . ) perhaps my current work on the various shades of meaning in english prepositions has biased me , but in any case i think that the difference in the various senses of " oversight " and " overlook " stems largely from their compounding with " over - " . " over " is sneaky ; at first glance it seems to be fairly limited in expressive power , but deeper analysis reveals that in it lurk a number of distinctions of meaning , some of them quite subtle indeed . in addition to nuances of physical location , " over " can indicate power relationships ( both outright force , and more subtle authority ) , value judgements , and the general notion of ( metaphorically ) moving on to another thing , as in " get over it " and " skip over " . so my analysis of " oversight " and " overlook " would be that in one sense , " over " takes on the meaning of authority-over , and in the other sense it takes on the meaning of skipping-over . perhaps a similar argument could be make for the " sight / see / look " part of the compound ? for instance , useages such as " see to it " " look to your own interest " seem to carry some of this " authority " meaning . i think the " over " analysis is more clear-cut , but it would be interesting to see if someone will make a case for the other half . - - marion kee marion kee | all opinions are my own ; knowledge engineer , center for machine translation | when cmu wants my opinions carnegie mellon university pittsburgh , pa , usa | it pays for them .

<subject> words that are their own opposites </subject> st isidore of seville may well be the source of " lucus a non lucendo , " as paul werth suggests . however , it 's no accident that benji wald attributed this ' etymology ' to varro ( 116-27 b . c . e . ) , as the latter is responsible for such etymological gems as vallum . . . quod ea varicare nemo posset " _ vallum _ ' camp wall ' because no one could _ varicare _ 's traddle over it ' " ( _ de lingua latina _ : v , 117 ) and qua vix agi potest , hinc angiportum ; qua nil potest agi , hinc angulus " where it is hardly possible for anything _ agi _ ' to be driven , ' from this it is called an _ angiportum _ ' alley ' ; where nothing can _ agi _ ' be driven , ' from this it is an _ angulus _ ' corner ' " ( ibid . : vi , 41 ) . a footnote in the loeb edition of _ de lingua latina _ refers to this as " derivation by the contrary meaning , " and cites another example : ludus , in quo minime luditur " school , in which there is very little playing " ( festus , 122 . 16m ) . karen baumer yale university

" lepschy also writes that abel 's ideas " were taken seriously by people of the calibre of pott , steinthal , and schuchardt " , and that freud repeatedly quoted abel 's work , viewing it " as a linguistic confirmation " of his own theory that " for the unconscious , opposites are equivalent to each other .

<subject> summary : whatever happened to 'd ? </subject> a few weeks ago i posted a query to the list regarding the disappearance of had or its contracted form ' d , in such expressions as she better stop , which appeared in a recent academic publication . i questioned people 's attitudes towards the standardisation of this new form ( better ) , the subsequent status of the bare infinitive ( stop ) , the possibility of its association with the extraposed construction it is better that she stop , ( implying a subjunctive analysis of stop ) and the likelihood of substituting another adjective ( e . g . good ) in place of better has a result of this . i also questioned the possibility of inverting better with the subject in interrogatives , given the analysis of it as an auxiliary form . i received 26 replies , and i would like to thank the following people who sent their comments , and anyone who is yet to do so : tamara al - kasey ; eleanor olds batchelder ; jonathon berg ; claudia brugman ; marsha bundman ; ellen contini - morava ; max copperman ; john cowan ( logical language group ) david fertig ; frederik fouvry ; dorine houston ; marge jackman ; roger lass ; deborah d . kela ruuskanen ; james kirchner ; timothy miller ; catherine rudin ; raphael salkie ; alena sanusi ; hal schiffman ; jane simpson ; dan slobin ; frits stuurman ; larry trask ; ivan uemlianen ; max wheeler . of 18 replies to the question of standardisation , 9 replied that it was not to be considered standard , 9 thought that it was either normal , informal or ok , and 8 did not consider this question . nobody liked the analysis of stop as a subjunctive , 2 people considering that the extraposed derivation sounded educated or stilted . one reply considered that stop was an imperative form . four people replied that better was an auxiliary , 7 thought it was a modal or semi-modal , and 2 thought that the construction was simply idiomatic . john cowan made mention of the use of better in yiddish - influenced american english as a sentence prefix : ' better she should n't go ' . with regard to its inversion in interrogatives , 9 people considered sai was not ok , one person thought it ok to invert in tags , and only one person thought main clause sai sounded ok . i also want to thank frederik fouvry for his reference : " information based syntax and semantics " ( hpsg vol . 1 , pollard & sag , 1987 ) in which better is analysed as an auxiliary that does n't allow inversion ; and frits stuurman for his references and comments : in g . gazdar , g . pullum , & i . sag ( 1982 ) " auxiliaries and related phenomena in a restricted theory of phrase structure " _ language _ 59 , 3 : 591-638 , pp . 610-611 , there is a reference to aren ' t as a similar case ( aren ' t i vs . i aren ' t ) ; and in gazdar , e . klein , pullum & sag ( 1985 ) _ generalized phrase structure grammar _ ( cambridge , mass . : harvard up ) , p . 64 , and gazdar , pullum & sag ( 1982 ) , p . 611 , footnote 17 , there are references to different meanings of modals like shall and might when inverted for interrogatives . frits stuurman also cites a gpsg reference to the use of better in p . sells ( 1985 ) _ lectures on government - binding theory , generalized phrase structure grammar , and lexical - functional grammar _ ( stanford : csli ) , p . 93 . many people found analogies with other modals that do not invert , e . g . claudia brugman mentions the difficulty of inverting ' she has to stop ' ) * ' has she to stop ? ' and gotta is equally impossible to invert . james kirchner also mentions otta as a similar case . tamara al - kasey compares the negative and the affirmative interrogatives : * ' had she better stop ? ' and ' had n't she better stop ? ' suggesting that the latter is more acceptable . other interesting items were : the vp - deletion version , observed by max wheeler ' we better had ' ; and at least 2 people considered that had seems to return only for inversion for interrogatives . generally , the use of inversion of better + subject was considered more common in tags , especially amongst children or teenagers , and jane simpson thinks that the tag bettern ' t you is now appearing in australian english , with or without the preceding ' d . ivan uemlianen ( british speaker from northern england ) claims he had always used the tag ' bettern ' t i ? ' as a child , which had always struck him as not quite right , and had never heard of the had until he heard it being used in old films . dan slobin considers the use of had to be archaic , or from another variety or era , although the inversion ' better she go ? ' does not appear in the speech of american - english preschoolers in their data . one respondent did n't know where the had came from , and another reanalysed it as would , in the same way as it has been reanalysed in conditional protases . another suggestion was that it was analogous to a pluperfect auxiliary without tense . two replied that the expression she better stop was just an example of sloppy editing . there was little discussion of phonological processes , but , in particular , i found interesting the following comments by roger lass : " in my dialect anyhow ( new york city middle class ) , it 's certainly normal to say ( and sometimes , in less formal registers , to write ) , i better , you better , he better , we better , they better . . . observe though : all the pronouns end with a vowel , and there are alternative forms , e . g . i 'd better . . . though these are much less common . there is however another type , which is sometimes taken to be better but is n't : you [ b ] better , where there 's a sort of geminate or at least half-long consonant . the very fact that none of the syntactic things you mark with * or ? seem to occur would be an indication that there has not really been any kind of reanalysis , but rather an institutionalization of a fast-speech deletion and / or assimilation , which is creeping up into slower styles ( as often happens ) . in fact the construction itself is weird anyhow , since you had comparative does n't seem to exist , except in archaisms like ' i 'd liefer do that ' ( i can't use it , but i ' ve heard it ) . note also , it 's just occurred to me , that you do n't get deletion of - 'd in * i rather do that . . . " this last comment i think gives us plenty of scope for more discussion . debbie ziegeler
<subject> 8 - bit characters </subject> dear fellow linguists : in the past months i have read several postings to this list using languages other than english ( spanish , german , french , finnish , italian , etc . ) . i consider this situation absolutely delicious , as it adds that international flavour that our discipline is so proud of . as english is not my native tongue , i welcome and exercise my right to use my language in all contexts . however , the notorious difficulty that 8 - bit characters have to travel in the cyberspace has made it really hard to send texts that comply with the spelling conventions of these languages ( basically accented and umlauted vowels , greek letters and certain other symbols ) . this is not a big problem when you are just sending a relatively short e-message to a colleague who speaks the same language ( you just drop the accents and type plain vowels or capitals instead , for enye you type a plain " n " , etc . ) . the real trouble arises when you wish to send a more polished document such as a paper , an abstract , a conference posting , a bibliography , a draft of a thesis to a distant supervisor , etc . in most of these cases the spelling norms * are * crucial . the obvious solution is the coding of 8 - bit characters as sequences of 7 - bit characters . i think that this has become a common practice , but i do n't know whether there is a standard for these conversions . if this coding practice has not yet been the object of standardisation , i venture to propose one below . this proposal refers to the characters available in the extended character set on ibm pc - compatible computers ( i am not familiar with mac , but this could also be used in that system ) . i would like to stress the fact that it is not necessary to type the ( long ) document using the coding system , rather the file must typed as usual , with accented and umlauted vowels as well as the rest of the characters needed in the language , and just after that you make a copy of the file and on that copy you change the 8 - bit characters for 7 - bit sequences according to the table provided . this procedure is * not * manual , for this you use the search-and - replace facility normally available in your word processor or editor ( remember : the dos editor has it ) . this can be done for most languages in ten or fewer passes ( less than one minute , varying with the size of the file ) . it is important to let the recipient know that you have coded the file in this fashion . append a note at the beginnig of the document to that effect , with a suggestion to use the search-and - replace facility to make the reverse changes , as well as the table of changes and samples . feel free to edit ( and / or translate ) what follows if you wish to make the note shorter by including only what is pertinent for a given language . | a . model of a note :

<subject> sum : singapore english </subject> content - length : 4261 a couple of weeks ago , i asked the following question : ) many people would not regard s ' pore english as a " native " english . ) however , there are many speakers here who grew up speaking ) english , ) ie acquiring english as their first language ; though certainly it may be a ) somewhat different variety from the english spoken in britain or ) america . ) in this respect , what is the currently accepted way of classifying ) singapore english ? in particular , is it possible to say that it is not a ) native language given that some people have it as their first ) language ? three respondants believed that singapore english should be regarded as " native " if it is the first language learned ; while three others suggested " native " has other connotations or suggested other terms for the english of singapore . thus anthea fraser gupta said : i strongly feel that the term " native language " should be used to refer to the language ( s ) an individual first learns , and that any other definition , based on race , on ancestral language use , or geographical origin , is untenable . debbie ziegeler agreed with this view : most people i believe would classify a first language as a native language ( = mother tongue ) , and i think this is what anthea gupta had in mind when she said that english in singapore now has native speakers , and that approximately 20 % of singapore 's incoming schoolchildren have english as a native language and ms . faridah hudson said : i believe that any language that is learned by a child as its first language should be considered as the native language . granted that singapore english is not as well studied as british or american english , it is still a form of english . on the other hand , wen - chao li claims suggests that " native " does not just refer to the linguistic experience of the individual : i think the word " native " here refers not to whether or not people speak the variety as a native language , but is just a convenient label used to distinguish the english of britain and the us , where the language originated ( " native " in this sense ) , from the english of places like singapore , india , and many countries in africa , where although english is widely spoken as a native language , it is a language that had transplanted another in the last 200 years , a language that was introduced rather than one that 's been culturally and historically " native " . mario cal varela suggested the use of the term " localized forms of english " for new varieties such as that of singapore : the expression " localized forms of english " is often used . . . to refer to varieties of english that have developed peculiar characteristics ( nativized features ) because of being used in cultural settings different from the so-called native englishes . and rodrik wade prefers " new englishes " : a term that was popularised , if not introduced by platt , weber and ho ( 1984 ) for se and other similar varieties of english is ' new englishes ' . i have used this term when writing about south african black english although as yet this variety has few l1 speakers . i would like to thank all these respondants , as well as alan firth and benny lee for their useful references and umberto for his questions about the pronunciation involved . special thanks to my mentor david deterding for introducing me to the list and for helping me out with this summary . kia - sheng chew national technological university singapore 91a26936217f @ nievax . nie . ac . sg

<subject> [ n + v ] verbal compounding </subject> content - length : 2725 we are two researchers at the universitat de girona ( sp ) and we are working on a kind of catalan verbal compounding . we sumarize the characteristics of these compounds here below . we are interested in other vo languales with the same ( or similar ) process of verb formation . moreover , we wonder if anybody knows references related , in some way , to our subject that could be helpful to us ( we already know rosen , s . t . ( 1989 ) , miller ( 1993 ) ) . [ n + v ] verbal compounding to be more clear we enumerate the relevant characteristics of our compounds . 1 . first of all , we must say that catalan is a vo language . 2 . our compounding looks like a process of noun incorporation where the incorporated noun within the lexical item is the internal argument in the syntactic structure . observe ( 1 ) ( 1 ) a . el cacador trenca la cama de l ' ocell " the hunter breaks the leg of the bird " b . el cacador camatrenca l ' ocell " the hunter leg + breaks the bird " 3 . nevertheless , the noun-incorporation does n't affect to the capacity of the verb of assigning acusative case , this is , the complex verb remains transitive . 4 . generally , this kind of " noun-incorporation " is only possible when the noun incorporated is an inalienable possession noun ( ipn ) and the new internal argument of the complex verb is the possessor . observe ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) : ( 2 ) a . corferir " to heart + hurt " b . colltorcer " to neck + twist " ( 3 ) a . * cadiratrencar " to chair + break " b . * ferrotorcer " to iron + twist " 5 . we hypothesise that the ipn acts as a kind of modifier in the complex verbal form and doestn ' t act as a verbal argument . olga fullana noell lluisa gracia pl . ferrater mora n . 1 universitat de girona e-17071 girona spain fullana @ skywalker . udg . es gracia @ skywalker . udg . es

<subject> isfc95 computational section </subject> announcement - - - - - - - - - - - - computational section / workshop at the 22nd international systemic - functional congress beijing , china 18-22 july 1995 the involvement of systemic functional linguistics in computational applications has grown to a point at which it would be beneficiary to take stock of the various ongoing activities . there are a number of interesting problems that arise if one uses systemic functional theory for natural language processing ( nlp ) . the goal of the section is to give researchers using systemic functional theory ( or aspects of it ) for nlp applications a chance to talk about issues of common interest , introduce their approaches to particular problems and ( perhaps ) work out solutions together . the idea is to organize the section as a mixture of talks and extensive discussions . if it turns out that there are some really burning issues , it is also possible to have workshops tailored to particular topics . if you are interested in participating - please fill in the attached form and e-mail it back to me ( teich @ darmstadt . gmd . de ) . - if you want to give a talk or introduce a topic for discussion or for a workshop , please e-mail an abstract of about 1 - 2 pages to me ( teich @ darmstadt . gmd . de ) . the abstract should include a title , your name and affiliation , a list of references and an indication of what it is intended as ( talk , topic for discussion or workshop ) . please send the abstract also , if you have already sent an abstract to the general call for papers of isfc95 . also , if you can think of anybody else who would be interested in participating , please forward this mail to them . the deadline for submissions and suggestions is the 15th of february 1995 . for general information about the conference please send mail to : egterenc @ hkpcc . hkp . hk - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - name : affiliation : address ( inlcuding e-mail ) : topics i work on : topics i would like to discuss : - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

<subject> affirmative 'd o ' </subject> i am working on a construction in a cape town dialect that involves the use of unstressed 'd o ' in affirmative contexts : e . g . ' i did go to the hall yesterday ' . no contrastive pre-supposition is intended ; speakers appear to be simply highlighting a 's alient ' activity ( there are present tense parallels too ) . although this is traditionally believed to be a ' contact ' feature of cape town english , it sounds to me rather like a relic from early modern standard english , reinforced by natural ( second language ) acquisition . the form does occur ( though possibly with different pragmatics ) in child language acquisition ( i have sporadic & unsystematic examples from britain ) ; but is soon weeded out of the grammar . question : does anyone know of any dialect ( any l1 or l2 form of english ; child language , early interlanguage etc . ) that has something similar ? ( i am familiar with early modern standard and earlier forms of 'd o ' ; with affirmative 'd o ' in ireland and the south - west of england - the pragmatics there are different , incidentally : ' habitual ' is not a function associated with the cape town dialect . ) thanks : raj mesthrie dept of linguistics university of cape town raj @ beattie . uct . ac . za
<subject> reduplicative constructions and polarity </subject> moravscik ( in greenberg 's language universals ) notes that reduplicative constructions that do not fulfill a purely grammatical function usually intensifies the base morpheme . sometimes , though , it may actually have the exact opposite function : it de-intensifies the base morpheme . i am interested in the connection between this process and the process by which the literal message of a sarcastic utterance assumes the exact opposite meaning by means of a conceptually similar feature : exaggeration ( of , say , amplitude , duration , pitch , or clarity ) . does anyone know of any further research on this particular phenomenon ? any speculations ? perhaps there is an intimate connection here with the polarity-based cognitive mapping givon ( in negation in language : pragmatics , function , ontology ) proposed ? sincerely , anders lars anders joensson macalester college email : ljonsson @ macalstr . edu
<subject> re : 6 . 39 have ) of </subject> it seems to me that the use of have + simple past is rapidly increasing in the u . s . it 's showing up now in newspapers and on television , and , perhaps most tellingly , in the speech of acquaintances who i am sure did not have it a few years ago . my first thought was that this had something to do with the have ) of reanalysis , but i have now heard too many instances of emphatic " have " to believe this . examples such as " even if he had went earlier , . . . " abound . i find these examples easy to spot because i still wince whenever i hear one .
<subject> c - insertion </subject> can anyone guide me to material documenting insertion of consonsants to break up impermissible vowel clusters , in which the choice of consonant is not conditioned by the nature of its surrounding vowels ? i ' m thinking , for example , of glides between non-high vowels , or relicts of consonants that were once there historically , but are no longer considered underlyingly present in the basic form of the word . thanks for any help . james kirchner

<subject> 200 </subject> summary on reduplication a month before christmas ( in linguist vol-5 - 1354 ) i sent out a query about * reduplication * and how this strategy is grammaticalized in languages to convey some facet of * intensification * . this is a summary based on the 45 replies i received from linguist netters . allow me to thank you all collectively now , since i will not be referring to single respondents in the following discussion . the topic of reduplication interests me because i am writing on my phd on repetition with respect to intensification and iconicity in swedish . the point of departure in the original query were the claims found in lakoff & johnson ( metaphors we live by ; 1980 ) according to which reduplication may indicate : - plural or collective - intensification or increase - continuation or completion - diminution thus , ' more ' of physical linguistic ' form ' corresponds to ' more ' in the ' content ' of the reduplicated expression as opposed to a non-reduplicated form - - as an instance of diagrammatic iconicity ( or as a realization of the * conduit * metaphor in the terms of lakoff & johnson ) . there are reflections of the outlined principles in colloquial english in expressions like ' an old old man ' , ' the music got louder and louder ' , 's he talks talks talks ' , ' the ball bounced and bounced ' , ' there 's forms forms forms forms ' , ' it was sinking down down ' , etc . i originally mentioned , however , that these structures were * marked * in a language like english . the choice of words was perhaps not so lucky . what i meant by " marked " is that even if we may think that such expressions are frequent in casual speech , they are rare in more constrained contexts . a less marked way of intensifying would probably be to use a specific intensifier or quantifier , e . g . ' a very old man ' , ' talks a lot ' . i hope no one will be offended by this simplistic analysis , it is only leading us a bit beside the point . ( for a comprehensive account on " repetition in english " , see persson 1974 , univ . of uppsala , sw . ) i was in my query more after pointers to and examples of languages where reduplication as a means of * intensification * is an integrated , so to speak , a standard characteristic of the grammar . this was also , more or less , what i got . i will summarize the outcome in the following ; i am aware of that in most instances the " facts " are probably subject to qualification , but for the sake of clarity & brevity i will lay the examples ahead in a rather list-like manner . furthermore , the examples certainly represent only a sample of the languages in the world that have incorporated reduplication in their system . note that i have left out - - in order to make it all more illustrative - - possible tone marks and diacritics of the transliteration . 1 . plural or collective * in malay / bahasa ( indonesia ) , full word reduplication turns singular to plural : anak ' child ' anak-anak ' children ' * in nahuatl ( or " aztec " ) , prefixed reduplication with nouns conveys a plural meaning : cih-tli ' hare ' ( where ' cih - ' is the stem ) ci : cih-tli pl . - - moreover , there are no structurally distinct adjectives in nahuatl but certain " adjectival " suffixes that can take on a plural notion via reduplication : - pi : l diminutive suffix - pipi : l plural * hausa is cited to have reduplication in the formation of plurals of a limited set of nouns . * in japanese , reduplication may turn a noun to a collective , but the scope of this strategy is said to be marginal : hito ' person ' hitobito ' people ' kami ' god ' kamigami ' gods ' * in mandarin ( chinese ) , reduplication turns singular to collective ( but this is said to be rare ) : ren ' person ' renren ' people ' - - moreover , both in mandarin and cantonese * classifier * items may be reduplicated to convey " universal quantification " in contrast to more unique reference . this fits readily in the notion of intensification ( or augmentation ) : ge ren ' a person ' ( mandarin ) ge ge ren ' every person ' douh ' place , there ' ( cantonese ) douh-douh ' everywhere ' * dakotan patterns plurals of stative intransitive verbs with reduplication . this is said only to apply to instances with inanimate subjects though . north american languages in general may be of interest when considering reduplication but i am short of examples at present . following languages were mentioned in the replies , though : klamath , nez perce , sahaptin . 2 . intensification or increase * mandarin chinese intensifies adjectives with reduplication : xiao 's mall ' xiaoxiao ' very small ' gaoxing ' happy ' gaogaoxingxing ' very happy ' as you notice , with disyllabic adjectives the reduplication pattern is aabb . - - cantonese also uses reduplication for augmentation or emphasis . * turkish is , apparently , a point in case . reduplication of adjectives indicates intensification or increase in the following way : temiz ' clean ' tertemiz ' very clean ' dolu ' full ' dopdolu ' very full ' bos ' empty ' bosbos ' completely empty ' here we have prefixed reduplication accompanied with a binding consonant . interestingly , there do not seem to be " rules " for which binding consonant should be inserted in a given case . * hausa is cited to use reduplication in the intensification of adjectives . * celtic languages have full word reduplication to indicate intensification . the method is reminiscent of the case of english , but it may be more " integrated " in the grammar of the celtic ( are there any opinions about this ? ) . could the celtic model have influenced germanic languages so that we still today have rather similar reduplication in the colloquial registers ( just my own modest idea . . . ) ? here are some examples provided by netters : - - welsh : ty bach bach ' a very small house ' oglau cryf cryf ' a very strong smell ' - - gaelic : fada fada ' very long ' trua trua ' very pity ' - - breton : braz-braz ' very tall ' this is said to be common especially in negative sentences . * in colloquial russian reduplication / repetition of adj 's / adv 's has likewise an intensifying function . the use is probably stylistically similar to repetition in colloquial english , but it is said to be limited to * predicate * adjectives : belyj-belyj ' very white ' tixo-tixo ' very quietly ' * it was also pointed that finnish has prefixed reduplication in some intensified adjectival forms . this is true , indeed , but - - what it seems - - wholly lexicalized and non-productive . in any case , here are some examples i and my colleague enjoyed coming up with : taysi ' full ' ( umlaut a ) tapo-taysi ' completely full ' ( uml . a 's & o ) tyhja ' empty ' ( uml . a ) typo-tyhja ' compl . empty ' ( uml . a 's & o ) puhdas ' clean ' puti-puhdas ' compl . clean ' uusi ' new ' upo-uusi ' brand new ' pinta 's urface ' piri-pinta ' right on the surface ' suomalainen ' finnish ' supi-suomalainen ' purely finnish ' yksin ' alone ' ypo-yksin ' compl . alone ' ( uml . o ) tiessaan ' lost ' ( uml . a 's ) tipo-tiessaan ' compl . lost ' ( uml . a 's & o ) the prefixed items ' tapo ' , ' typo ' , ' tipo ' , 's upi ' , ' puti ' , ' piri ' , ' upo ' , ' ypo ' do not seem to mean anything , at least for the speakers today . it seems that the first vowel or the pair first consonant & vowel of the stem are reduplicated with a binding syllable that most often has a ' p ' and a vowel , e . g . : ta-po - taysi , ty-po - tyhja , u-po - uusi , y-po - yksin could this have been productive in some earlier stage of the language ? * finally , in classical ( only ? ) greek a small number of * verbs * may have reduplication to communicate some sort of intensifying , expressive or affective notions : pam-phain - ei ' it shines brightly ' ( ( * phan-phan - j-ei ) 3 . continuation or completion reduplication is , evidently , often used in the formation of present , progressive or perfective . i take here the view that present or progressive forms combine with * continuation * , whereas perfective forms communicate * completion * . it was nice to discover that " classical " linguistic tradition can offer fitting data here . it feels appropriate to begin with these examples . - - - * in sanskrit , the perfect stem is formed by reduplication : budh - ' know ' bubodh - perf . jan - ' born ' jajan - perf . aorist ( ' true perfect ' ) roots may also be formed by a kind of reduplication : jan - ajijana - ( aor . ) in addition , present stems may be formed by reduplication : bhii - 'd rink ' bibhii - pres . * classical greek uses partial reduplication , i . e . prefixation of the initial consonant of a verb plus the vowel ' e ' , in stems for perfect tenses : le-lu - k-a ' i have freed ' pe-poie : - k-a ' i have made ' ge-grap - tai ' it has been written ' if the root begins with a vowel , the vowel is augmented . furthermore , some common verbs take reduplication in their * present * tense ; the initial consonant is reduplicated with the vowel ' i ' : di-do : - mi ' i give / am giving ' gi-gno - mai ' i am becoming ' ti-the : - mi ' i am placing ' ( ( * thi-the : - mi ) * in latin , perfect forms may involve reduplication : curro ' run ' cucurri perf . - - - let us then go over to more living languages . * in hausa , reduplication applied to verbs in two different ways expresses completion or continuity respectively . modified suffixed reduplication gives an idea of * completed * action : cika ' fill ' cikakke compl . jefa ' throw ' jefaffe compl . prefixed reduplication communicates " something like continuity " , as expressed by the respondent : buga ' beat ' bubbuga ' keep on beating ' kira ' call ' kikkira ' call various people ' * in tagalog ( philippines ) , reduplication distinguishes * imperfective * actions from perfective : bili root of ' buy ' bibili irrealis imperfective upo root of 's it ' uupo irr . imp . kuha root of ' get ' kukuha irr . imp . some scholars call irrealis perfective * completed * aspect and irrealis imperfective * contemplated * aspect . this makes sense , since irrealis imperfective ' bibili ' seems to translate to ' will buy ' . * in wailevu / fijian ( austronesia ) , reduplication is used in so called " object defocusing " that involves repetition of the action and a progressive marker : au xau-ta na agone ' i carry the child ' au xau-xau jixo ' i ' m carrying now ' au dola-va na xaatuba ' i open the window ' au dola-dola jixo ' i ' m opening now ' moreover , in this language adjectives may be derived from verbs through reduplication . even if noted to be " not productive " , the process is fascinating : sava-ta ' wash - tr ' sava-sava - a ' clean ' the adjective could be understood to represent * completed * action , the result , in a way very similar to how the perfect participle works in , say , germanic : she has washed the cloth . - - ) a washed cloth * in nahuatl ( " aztec " ) , reduplication may affect the meaning of a verb in several ways . - - an action carried out in a " systematic " ( progressive ? ) way : tequi base for ' to slice ' or ' to hack ' te : tequi 's lice / carve something ' cho : ca ' weep ' cho : cho : ca ' weep continuously ' - - of the same base verbs , an action carried out in a " random " ( involving repetition ? ) way : tehtequi ' hack something up ' chohcho : ca ' to sob ' - - furthermore , reduplication may be recursive ( e . g . of ' weep continuously ' & 's ob ' respectively ) : cho : cho : cho : ca chohchohcho : ca - - verbs with certain morphologic characteristic may take on reduplication to indicate * repeated action * : tzili : ni ' make a metallic sound ' tzttzilica ' jingle ' tzitzilitza ' make something jingle ' * in afrikaans , reduplication applied to some verbs seems give a progressive idea : hy loop eet-eet ' he eats continuously while walking ' 4 . diminution there are not many examples of * diminution * in the total of replies . in a sense , the process of " making something smaller " could possibly go under the more general strategy of * intensification or increase * ( although it is literally about " decrease " ) . nevertheless , there were a couple of possibly fitting cases : * cantonese may use reduplication to convey * diminution * or * moderation * . * it was pointed that english ( ! ) has some " diminutive " reduplication in formations like ' itsy-bitsy ' , ' eensie - weensie ' , ' teeny-tiny ' . these carry the content ' very small ' , but they belong merely to the child-speak register . in any case , the examples are diagnostic of the diminutive case . 5 . other there are uses of reduplication that go beyond the suggested four categories above . with some restraint , some of these could perhaps be seen as slight offsprings of the more general principle of marking * plurality * . i do not go into detailed examples but mention some most common semantic categories : - - distributive reduplication : presupposes two or more referents that are taken separately ( type : ' one by one ' ) - - reflexive notions go naturally hand in hand with distributive ( type : ' one another ' ) - - the so called * delimitative aspect * , i . e . 'd oing something for a while ' , in mandarin and cantonese does not at first seem to fit in * continuity * or * completion * . however , the semantics of the delimitative aspect is said to encompass " implied repetition " : tai-tai ' take a look at ' ( cant . ) chang-chang ' have a taste ' ( man . ) shi-shi ' have a go ' ( man . ) what would seem logical to me is that a casual , temporally short action like ' take a look ' reaches its termination quicker than standard ' looking ' . i do n't know if this kind of an implicit sense of " rapid completion " could be the motivation of this reduplication ? - - - then there are numerous instances of reduplication that communicate * contrastive emphasis * . these do not necessarily combine with the above functional categories at all . the motivation of such reduplication is merely to * make a point * clearer . the ( american ) english " double " is a seemingly nice example of this : shall we rent a car car , or would you rather have a jeep ? of course , emphasis is a sort of * intensification * and , thus , it touches the theme of our discussion . * * * * now i think it 's time to close this rather lengthy summary . thanks for reading it . if you would like to add something to the discussion - - like comment on my suggestions - - , feel free to e-mail ( or snailmail ) the " stuff " directly to me .

<subject> phonetics texts </subject> dear linguists , last month i posted a query on phonetics texts suitable for a 10 - week undergraduate course . i received many helpful responses from : chuck coker , yoshi asano , marc picard , charles read , darlene lacharite , nigel love , geoffrey nathan , steve seegmiller , don churma , frances ingemann , peter ladefoged , hal edwards , and one linguist who preferred not to be listed . thanks to all of you ! the book most often recommended is peter ladefoged 's , but others are also recommended in cases where the course is focused on the description of english only . geoff nathan pointed out that there are hypertext programs with examples stored as sound files that go with ladefoged 's text ; the edwards text has accompanying workbook , instructor 's manual and lab tapes . marc picard very kindly sent me the bibliography he gives to students in his class . i hope he does not mind that i have added to it the items referred to in the other replies i received to create the enclosed summary bibliography . call numbers are from marc 's list , and are those from libraries in montreal , for those of you lucky enough to live there . again , my thanks to all who replied ! susan meredith burt here is the combined list of references : abercrombie , david ( 1967 ) elements of general phonetics . edinburgh university press .

<subject> t </subject> thanks to everyone who responded to my questions about latex fonts and using linux in general . respondents were : jen hay ( jennifer . hay @ vuw . ac . nz ) mark hale ( hale1 @ husc . harvard . edu ) greg iverson ( iverson @ csd . uwm . edu ) " james a . mcgilvray " ( jim @ dep . philo . mcgill . ca ) michael covington ( mcovingt @ ai . uga . edu ) james magnuson ( magnuson @ hip . atr . co . jp ) uli sauerland ( sauerlan @ mit . edu ) tom green ( tmgreen @ mit . edu ) " larry trask " ( larryt @ cogs . susx . ac . uk ) ted . harding @ nessie . mcc . ac . uk ( ted harding ) " c . a . creider " ( creider @ julian . uwo . ca ) mark liberman ( myl @ sansom . ling . upenn . edu ) first of all , the responses clearly indicate that there exists at least two ipa fonts for latex ( see below ) . responses to my more general questions ranged from enthusiastic encouragement about using latex and linux , to fervernt wishes that i rethink my abandonment of the macintosh os , to recommendations of other operating systems and / or text-processing or dsp systems . i should perhaps have mentioned that i am already relatively familiar with bsd unix , so switching to linux will not be much of a shock in and of itself - though obviously using latex will be quite a change from a mac - based word processor . . . the score is currently : pro latex w / ipa : 7 pro linux : 4 pro mac : 1 pro nextstep : 1 anti latex : 1 and a number of somewhat mixed responses , suggesting for the most part that i remain with a mac for text processing , but work with some kind of unix environment for dsp and data processing , or that i stick with a mac for the actual sound manipulation but switch to linux for everything else . re : dsp there were at least two recommendations for signalyze for the macintosh , and two for ogi-tools for unix systems . some select quotes ( anonymously to discourage os partisanship from seeping into real life ) : " i thoroughly recommend switching to latex . " " i ' m running a linux box and use latex for all professional word - processing these days . . . i have n't found anything i can't do yet . " " i ' ll say this for linux , compared to dos , windows , os / 2 , desqview , and windows nt ( latest versions of all ) , i ' ve been running linux for a year and a half and it has never once crashed . never . every one of those others has . " " gee , i hope switching from a macintosh to a linux workstation is n't too painful . . . do you really have to do this ( power macintosh machines are indeed powerful , and the word processing situation is well developed with wordperfect 3 . 1 , nisus writer 4 . 06 , others ) . " " while on the topic of unix instantiations of tex , you might look at nextstep instead of linux . . . next 's gui is , honestly , elegant . " " there are several good ipa font sets for latex , as well as a whole bunch of accents available even if you do n't use special fonts . " " i use latex ( both on linux and on other unixes ) for all my papers and there are a couple good packages of phonetic symbol fonts that work great with latex . " " first of all , i dislike latex intensely , as do most of my colleagues in linguistics . we find it uniquely user-hostile : basically , you can't change any defaults unless you have a degree in hacking . . . on the whole , then , my advice is to stay away from latex . " " i am a linux user , and can assure you that latex and all sorts of extensions work very well with linux . so if you can find the linguistic tools for latex you should be able to use them with linux . " i have also had a few requests that i share the information regarding where to find latex ipa fonts : there are apparently at least two , maybe more . one is called tsipa and is from japan . another is called wsuipa , and is from washington state university . one other person mentioned a font set from waterloo , but did not give more details . tsipa is available at ftp . shsu . edu in tex-archive / fonts / tsipa a couple people mentioned the tex - for-linguists newsgroup , at listserv @ shsu . edu , but this may no longer be running . there is also a tex newsgroup , comp . text . tex for more info . thanks again to all the people who responded so quickly . i am going to give the linux / latex system a shot , and see what i can make of it . - alex afrancis @ midway . uchicago . edu alex francis ( 312 ) - 667-5432 department of linguistics afrancis @ midway . uchicago . edu university of chicago ( 312 ) 667-5432 ( home ) 1010 e . 59th st .

<subject> re : racist linguist plot ( linguist list : vol-5 - 1467 ) </subject> regarding steven schaufele 's recent posting on " language amongst the anthropoidea , or , the racist linguist plot " , wherein he claims never to have noticed any anti-animal " racism " in his training : i remember knowing about racism but not yet knowing about institutionalized racism - - wherein an institution is so permeated with racism that people are not even aware that what they say or do is racist . but let 's change the word " racist " to * species-ist * , since 1 ) racist does n't exactly fit cross-species issues except in the older meaning of " human race " , 2 ) species-ist points more clearly to our anthropocentrism , and 3 ) i no longer like to use the current concept of race because the history of its use over only the past 100 years with this particular meaning ( check the oed ) has not proven useful to me for inclusion into any explanations . dr . schaufele says , ) i certainly do n't remember anything in the introductory survey ) courses i ' ve taken myself . . . so much as hinting that it is an ) a priori assumption of the field of linguistics that language ) is the exclusive prerogative of homo sapiens . maybe the hints were all around , but never noticed . let 's next consider whether linguistics may be guilty of not overt but * covert * and institutionalized species-ism , embedded so pervasively as to be invisible to some . moonhawk 's institutionalized species - ism hypothesis predicts that unwitting species-ism will be reflected : * in textbooks through the positing of such processes as syntax and morphology ( which we claim animals do n't have ) as " universals of language " * in the use of metonymy ( part for whole ) to define * language * in terms of these putative universals , syntax & morphology , processes we claim only humans have , and then in calling everything else without such machinery * communication * ( which * true linguists * do n't study or publish on . ( n . b . , it 's not like you can go to a school or department of * communication * to study how animals communicate - - - so this is terminological limbo : few linguists really care what animals do ; it 's seen as irrelevant ) . * such truisms as " there are no primitive languages " in our intro classes - - where primitive is tacitly understood to mean " with reduced or without the machinery of morphology & syntax " . ( this automatically disallows what apes , cetaceans and others do from being called language , given our other claims above . ) * the omission of " chimpanzee " in the inventory of world 's languages * such constructs as lad ( language acquisition device ) and " innate predisposition to language " applied uniquely to humans . ( have you ever seen anyone positing either construct for the great apes or cetaceans ? ) * in standard theories and stories on the " origins of language " with exclusively human protagonists ( bow - wow and yo - he - ho theories , biblical tower of babel ) * in language acquisition classes that study primarily what humans do , with some emphasis on how humans diverge from animals just for comparison 's sake , to see how we take off developmentally from where they stop * in such phrases as " uniquely human " and " social contract " ( " signs of the apes , songs of the whales , " , nova , 1984 , discussing washoe 's use of asl : " washoe has crossed the line into exclusively human territory . " ) these are just the tip of the iceberg , off the top of the head . look around with sensitive eyes and you ' ll see the subtle signs of this species-ism everywhere . no one has to plot or say anything overtly species-ist because , given the totality of our system , animals can never break through our self-imposed cultural definitional language barrier ( as sue savage - rumbaugh so aptly notes ) . if a chimp and a child perform exactly the same behavior , the child 's is adjudged * linguistic * and the chimp 's is not , because children , unlike chimps , are said to be " on their way to language " ( i . e . , syntax ) . [ thanks to marilyn silva for her assistance to this point ; she thoroughly disavows any connection with what follows ! ] just so that we may see this species-ism more clearly , first a teaching i ' ve posted before , and then a brief outline for a model from a species-inclusive point of view that flows from the teaching . " long ago , men and animals and spirits and plants all communicated in the same way . then something happened . after that , humans had to speak to each other in human speech . but we retained the old language for dreams , and for communicating with spirits , animals , and plants . " this is what a non-species - ist ( cheyenne ) language origin story looks like - - all of nature communicating in a common way , and then * humans * moving out of that system and doing something different , the human kind of language , but remaining still connected to the original language processes whether they know it or not . wilhelm von humbolt , founder of linguistics as a university discipline , observed : " man , regarded as an animal , belongs to one of the singing species ; but his notes are always associated with ideas . " non - species-ist accounts are alway inclusive and evolutionary , not exclusive . and now for a model that flows naturally from the story . 1 ) we now call * language * every " natural system " which has utterances ( incl . sound , gesture , chemical , etc . ) combined with meaning . 2 ) we notice that as well as this sharing , humans also have differences - - different language processes that animals do n't seem to have ( morphology & syntax ) , so we call them two processes of human-specific language , the human kind of language , or just * human language * - - but we no longer designate it by merely the bare word * language * in the old exclusivist , species-ist way . this model declares that humans partake of other processes in the more inclusive * language * as well as those of specifically * human language * , so we look for similarities between humans and animals . indeed , both have motor / gestural components and spatial syntax associated with utterances and meaning , and both ( at least those with limbic systems * * * ) modulate emotions into their utterances . and , perhaps most important of the similarities , both utter idioms ! idioms are funny critters , when you think about it ; as the george foremans of the * hidden side * of linguistics - - the part of human language that does n't work by normal human language rules - - they tend to knock out every bit of morphological and syntactic machinery they encounter , not play by the rules , and consequently can help us question our culturally condoned uniqueness attitude as well . let me explain . it struck me recently , and i ' ve never encountered anyone else discussing this similarity , that the definition of idioms or formulaic speech - - utterances whose meaning cannot be pieced together from the meanings of the pieces , but must be attached to the whole utterance - - is exactly the same as the definition for any act of non-human communication you can find in the textbooks ( for bee dances , bird songs , etc . ) . in fact this definition is perhaps why non-human beings are usually said not to have ( human ) language - - because the pieces of their utterances can't be added up to make the whole meaning the way we say we can using morphology and syntax in human language . humans and animals thus intersect in * language * , in its entire evolutionary range , at most levels - - idioms , sounds , emotions , gestures ( pheromones ? ) - - and then humans only sometimes also construct new utterances from scratch . most typically we tend to use more idioms & formulaic speech with those we know well , and use it less with strangers , with whom we tend to use more formal and public speech . bees and birds and trees tend to know each other in their groups very well and can therefore be said to use idioms in their own languaging . just like us ! - - that is , unless we want to call ourselves sub-human and merely communicating , not using language , when we use idioms and formulaic speech . this move , should you accept it , irrevocably puts humans , land animals , sea creatures , trees , and maybe more , all on the same * language * map . but can these ' wild ' speculations , however evolutionarily based , actually be accomodated within a " real " linguistic theory ? about 15 years ago , charles fillmore was working on a unified approach i really admire ( and perhaps it 's a partial fulfillment of the reconciliation annabel cormack called for in vol-5 - 1469 on trends in lx ) , which goes something like this ( any errors are mine ) : when we are " online " composing / speaking , which i now must see as similar to dan slobin 's " thinking for speaking " mode , our process is to ' reach ' first for a handy ready-made piece of formulaic speech , and then , failing that - - lacking a ' match ' or not liking the proffered ' match ' - - we go on to construct from scratch . nature simply does n't have the further " from scratch " level , but shares everything to that level . fillmore 's formulation seems to fit quite nicely the picture of the evolutionary development of language ( and its synchronic effects ) that i have attempted to sketch here . ( sorry for any embarassment my use of it may have caused you , chuck ! ) the degree to which the above species-inclusive formulations may tend to disturb you quite faithfully reflects , i would guess , the degree to which you are embedded in the institutionalized species-ism so pervasive in linguistics , since these formulations are quite possibly the first truly * alternative * origins theory you have ever seen . because language and intelligence are usually linked , this more compassionate model also has the advantage of placing intelligence in nature and not so much the burden of just human beings . with this approach , linguistics could forge an academic path toward reconcilliation between western minds and nature that could provide a powerful rationale for at least slowing down , if not stopping altogether , the current ecocide , and instituting a new-though - ancient attitude of * respect * for the intelligence of nature . no linguist who sincerely wants to understand what * language * is all about can any longer afford to ignore its deeper processes in nature - - natural language , of which human natural language is an important subset . * * * anyone wishing to see how this inclusive approach further includes brainmind research - - the relevant evolution of brain structures and of brainwave rhythms - - can contact me at dalford @ s1 . csuhayward . edu . - - moonhawk ( % - ) ) ( " the fool on the hill sees the sun going down and ) ( the eyes in his head see the world spinning round " ) ( - - mccartney / lennon )
<subject> cuba </subject> in november i posted a query as to whether anyone on the list , particularly in the usa , had had any experience of , or problems with , communicating with cuban academics . only four people replied , which may in itself be significant . anyway , thanks to those four for their communications . to summarise : 1 . two people i know have been asked for offprints by linguists at havana university . 2 . there was an exhibition by some ' third world ' americans at the biennial contemporary art exhibition just held in cuba , reported in the november issue of ' new art examiner ' . 3 . some academics received last year a call for papers for an international conference in cuba including areas on speech processing , computational linguistics etc . the contact was : dr eloina miyares bermudez ( cmstg @ ceniai . cu ) . 4 . one respondent from the list told me that it is possible to e-mail cuba from the us . there is another source of information in the form of an e-mail list in spanish , espana - l @ albnyvm1 . bitnet , which is primarily a social list for people who speak spanish ( spanish is the language of the list ) and are spanish or interested in spain . the cuba-l list can be read and contributed to worldwide . on several occasions , a member has forwarded something from cuba to the list , including recently a cri de coeur quoting passages of the cuban constitution and demonstrating that it was actually a travesty . the original writer , a cuban , was very openly decrying the cuban constitution . the poster quoted por - tions of the constitution , then gave examples of how the regime flouts it to the harm of the cuban people and the self-aggrandizement of castro , the local police captain , or " the system " in general . that writer seemed to have no fear of retribution , as if the cuban list were the only safe place to speak up , and were indeed safe , unlike whispers in the corner bar . the correspondent finishes : " castro can't keep cubans from speaking freely , and the us government can't keep americans from listening to or talking with the cubans . " if anyone else wishes to comment , please forward your communications to me , and i ' ll produce another summary . paul . foulkes @ uk . ac . newcastle

<subject>  </subject> syntax marcus maia . the comprehension of object anaphora in brazilian portuguese . usc . 1994 . distributed by gsil publications , usc . this thesis examines the comprehension of the empty category and the third person lexical pronoun in object position in brazilian portuguese ( bp ) . experimental results show that the processing of bp overt and nonovert objects is consistent with the leading idea underlying the overt pronoun constraint ( opc ) proposed by montalbetti ( 84 ) . experiment 1 compares the processing of overt pronouns and empty categories in object position in bp in structures in which these anaphors are a - bound by a subject and in structures in which they are a - bar-bound by a topic . results from 48 bp speakers indicate reactivation of the antecedents only by topic-bound gaps and by subject-bound overt pronouns in experiment 2 , the difference between the coreferential vs . bound readings in bp is further investigated by comparing the possibility of the strict and sloppy readings for the overt pronoun and the gap in object position . based on these experimental results , we argue for the classification of the bp null object as an instance of a null epithet , an empty r - expression with pronominal properties . the experiments are also informative with relation to several theoretical psycholinguistic issues . for more information , please contact gsil publications gsil @ scf . usc . edu south asian langs pan-asiatic linguistics : proceedings of the third international symposium on language and linguistics . chulalongkorn university , bangkok , thailand . 8-10 january 1992 . 1482 pp .

<subject> kant and innateness </subject> references to innateness in kant are not easy to find , but here is one that is relevant to the current controversy regarding linguistic " realism " vs . " conceptualism . " a middle course may be proposed bewtween the two above mentioned , namely , that the categories are neither self-thought first principles apriori of our knowledege nor derived from experience , but sujective dispositions of thought , implanted in us from the first momement , so ordered by our creator that their employment is in complete harmony with the laws of nature in accordance with which experience proceeds - - a kind of preformation-system of pure reason . . . there is this decisive ojection . . . that the necessity of the categories . . . then would have to be sacrificed . ( b167-168 . _ critique of pure reason _ trans . kemp smith . ) noam chomsky observes that " rationalist " as well as " empiricist " theories of language incorporate " innate dispositions . " ( _ reflections on language _ . pantheon . 1975 . p . 215 ) whether the logical modalities enter the linguistic picture is uncertain , but one can imagine that on some formulation of minimality the connection with economy of derivation may be necessary in some sense , to choose a possible example just for the purpose of illustration . if so , then such modalities may not exclude " psychologism " in linguistics and with it conceptualism ala chomsky . one consequence would be that arguments against extending linguistic " psychologism " to logic would not be barred for the fregean reasons sometimes cited by linguists ( e . g . katz and postal in _ linguistics and philosophy _ . 14 , 1991 . p . 520 . the importance of kant for the history of the philosophy of linguistics is not innateness , rather it is in recognizing that concepts are rules . ( ibid . a106 ) . these rules allow the identification of the forms of " judgments . " within a framework of rules ( " principles " ) and parameters , kant 's view of concepts takes on special significance , eventually pointing toward a possible resolution of the question of the place of linguistics within science . steven bayne ( grad student ) uconn , linguistics stevenbayne @ delphi . com
<subject> sum : words that are their own opposites , pt . 1 </subject> in november , i posted a query about what i referred to as " auto-antonymy " , the semantic state of a word being its own opposite , either changing its meaning through time or having two opposite meanings at the same time . an example of the former is " resent " which used to mean " appreciate " as in the following quotations taken from the oxford english dictionary : 1702 c . mather magn . chr . iii . i . iii . ( 1852 ) 309 if she gratefully resented that small thing for the sake of the hand it came from . 1765 warburton in w . & hurd lett . ( 1809 ) 360 , i was sure that this instance of his friendship to you would ever be warmly resented by you . 1829 webster lett . ( 1902 ) 617 , i shall resent through life ( to use an expression of boyle 's ) your unwearied and affecting kindness to me . a word that has two opposite meanings simultaneously is " fast " , which means steady , not moving , and at high speed . i asked what the proper term for this phenomenon is , and made a call for other examples of this phenomenon in english and other languages . additionally , i asked whether this a phenomenon that can be rightfully classed with other regular forms of polysemy ( metonymy , metaphor ) and language change , or is it always a curious accident . thanks to the kind responses of linguists around the world , i now know six established names for " auto-antonymy " , i have a collection of many interesting examples , and i have been apprised of a dual phenomenon : synonyms that look like antonyms . these linguistic riches will be shared in the following screens . first , the terminology . dirk geeraerts writes that the phenomenon " is known in the older tradition of historical semantics as ( antiphrasis ) or < enantiosemy > " . miriam shlesinger and m . lynne murphy noted that such words are sometimes called ( janus words ) , after the two-faced greek mythic figure . larry horn , renowned historian of negation , said the phenomenon had been dubbed ( antilogy ) by john train in his 1980 book " remarkable words with astonishing origins . david gamon offered the term ( enantiodromia ) for : the diachronic process of acquiring an ' opposite ' meaning , and i suppose a : word having two such meanings would be an ( enantiodrome ) . i learned this , : by the way , from professor matisoff here at berkeley . bob fradkin noted that arabic has a word ( didh ) ( plural < addhaadh > ) for " a whole category of words that mean ' itself and its opposite . ' " frankly , i think that all of these terms - - antiphrasis , enantiosemy , janus word , antilogy , enantiodromia ( not to mention didh ) - - are quite opaque to the modern english ear , and the word i coined , " auto-antonym " just says it all , and that 's the term i ' ll use for the remainder of this post . now that i ' ve whetted your appetite for some auto-antonymy , here are the examples i received : the top entry , submitted by practically everybody , is the classic example ( cleave ) which means to bring together as well as to cut apart . < splice > and ( clip ) , mentioned less often , operate the same way . another popular word was ( sanction ) , which as a noun means a punitive action and as a verb means to endorse . ( let ) is similar , also meaning to allow , but formerly meaning to prevent . the latter meaning survives in the idioms " without let or hindrance " and in " a let ball " . kevin rottet notes a similar phenomenon in french , with the word ( defendre ) meaning ' to defend ' and ' to prohibit ' . many mentioned " overlook " or " oversight " which can mean to look at something carefully as well as to miss something . jane edwards notes that german translation ( versehen ) has the same properties . speaking of german , bernd moebius writes : in german , ' kontrahent ' today means ' opponent ' ( e . g . , often used in sports ) [ . . . . ] there is , however , the rather uncommon use of ' kontrahent ' for two parties sharing a contract , like the english ' contractor ' . karen baumer wins the prize for sending in the most entries . these had been collected by her colleagues at the apple newton project . i give you a selection of the ones not mentioned previously : ) > > aught = all , nothing ) > > bill = invoice , money ) > > comprise = contain , compose ) > > custom = usual , special ) > > dust = to remove , add fine particles ) > > literally = actually , figuratively ) > > model = archetype , copy ) > > moot = debatable , academic ) > > note = promise to pay , money ) > > peer = noble , person of equal rank ) > > put = lay , throw ) > > puzzle = pose problem , solve problem ) > > quantum = very small , very large ( quantum leap ) ) > > ravel = entangle , disentangle ) > > resign = to quit , to sign up again ) > > sanguine = murderous , optimistic ) > > scan = to examine closely , to glance at quickly ) > > set = fix , flow ) > > skin = to cover with , remove outer covering ) > > strike = miss ( baseball ) , hit ) > > table = propose [ british ] , set aside ) > > temper = calmness , passion ) > > trim = cut things off , put things on ) > > a very short list of homophones : ) > > aural , oral = heard , spoken ) > > raise , raze = erect , tear down ) > > ) > > a pair of french words which can be very confusing : ) > > la symetrie ( symmetry ) and l ' asymetrie ( asymmetry ) . ) > > ) > > latin : ) > > immo = yes , no baumer also notes : an example that comes to mind is the word ' prove , ' whose older meaning ' to test ' has been pretty much lost , giving rise to an apparent paradox in the expression " the exception proves the rule . " there were quite a few examples from shakespeare . julie vonwiller explains , ( presently ) in shakespeare meant ' immediately ' whereas now it means ' not immediately but i ' ll get round to it ' . roger hurwitz reminds us of shakespeare 's ( nunnery ) , which , in the phrase " get thee to a nunnery " referred not to a place of piety , but a house of ill repute . sue blackwell , pointed me to " as you like it " , wherein jacques de boys complains : " rumination wraps me in a most ( humourous ) sadness . " not at all funny . blackwell adds that ( silly ) used to mean " blessed " . here are some examples in other languages that have no parallels in english : an example from dutch : " ettelijk " . most native speakers ( everybody ) thinks it means " many , much " , but the authoritative dictionary ( van dale ) says it means " ( a ) little , ( a ) few " . or at least that is what the dictionary said 10 or 15 years ago ( and our professor of dutch used to " catch " us on this one ) . now for the sake of this message i went to look again in a new version of van dale and it says both ! see the evolution ? - - patricia haegeman a swedish example is the verb " maximera " ( ' maximize ' ) . the traditional meaning is 's et an upper limit to ' , but now it is also being used in the sense ' make as large as possible ' , probably due to english influence . - - mats eeg-olofsson there 's a strange case in the sahidic dialect of coptic : " ehrai " means both " upwards " and " downwards " . the former derives from egyptian h . ry " upper part " ( in which h . represents a pharyngial fricative ) , the latter derives from egyptian h _ ry " lower part " ( in which h _ was probably a palatal fricative ) . the distinction between h . and h _ was lost in coptic . - - lance eccles , maquarie university , australia i think that 's enough for now . in a future posting i will summarize the linguistic wisdom on the regularity of the phenomenon . - - alex eulenberg ( aeulenbe @ indiana . edu ) - - indiana university

<subject> machine usable dictionary </subject> as you may know from postings i have made to this list over the last couple of months , derek bickerton and i are developing a parser based on a theory of syntax that he and i have been developing over the last four years . we are about to purchase a machine usable dictionary with approximately 70 , 000 entries for $ 2500 . if anyone could advise us whether or not that is our best bet , or where we might find other dictionaries , we would appreciate hearing from you . we are currently working with a dictionary of under 1000 words , so it is imperative that we obtain a larger one , so we may begin working with larger corpora . toward that end we would also like to find out which texts were used in past parsing competitions and where the results of these competitions are published . we believe that with a few weeks of work we should be able to modify a dictionary sufficiently to allow us to begin experinmenting with texts that were used in past parsing competitions . here are the specs the parser . it is based on a series of algorithms that have been four years in the making , but the programming required to create this parser has only taken 300 hours using c + + . there areapproximately 3000 lines of code that take up 150k executable on disk . about 100k of ram is required to run the parser . 30k on disk is required for a 300 word dictionary . an average sentence takes under 4 seconds to process on a 486 ibm compatible . since this is only a development version , we expect these numbers to change . to date , no optimizations have occurred , and we expect to significantly shrink the dictionary disk usage and the execution time . phil bralich bralich @ uhccux . uhcc . hawaii . edu

<subject> synthetic compounds summary </subject> dear colleagues , in april i sent a query to linguist about synthetic compounds . i received over 30 replies . i have tried to respond personally to all of the replies , but a couple of my messages bounced . i apologize to anyone i missed . i appreciated all of the response i received . i am proud to be a part of intellectual community where so many people are eager to share their hard won knowledge . a summary of what i have learned follows . it can be divided into four parts . part 1 presents some questions about what i had taken as given in my initial query . part 2 consists of a bibliography of works that i and others have found useful in our research on compounds . part 3 . is a table showing the data i have so far . i encourage you to look over it may surprise you or you may disagree with what i say about your favorite language ( if you do please write me , i know very little about most of these languages and have no way of judging if what i have read about them is the widely accepted view . in part 4 i explain the project i am currently working on and make yet another call for data ( no matter how much i get i want more ) . i hope that this summary is useful for most of you and interesting to at least some . part 1 : i got some very interesting replies to my query which instead of or in addition to offering data , questioned the very notion of synthetic compounds that i had based my query on . my post was as follows : i am looking for information on synthetic compounds like the english " truck driver " and the french " essuie-glace " where one element of the compound is a verbal and the other element is interpreted as its object . i am trying to find out if there is any connection between the ordering of the elements in these compounds and the ordering of the elements in a vp . i already have information on how these compounds are formed and used in english , french , spanish , italian , dutch , igbo , and jacaltec , but have been unable , despite hours in the library , to find information on other languages . the questions fell into two main categories ? 1 . what did i mean by " synthetic " compounds ? on the surface this seems like a simple terminological question but it goes much deeper than that . in researching this type of compounds i have seen them called by any number of names ; deverbals , verbals , v + n , v + o , nominalizations . . . . . i do n't know where the term " synthetic " comes from i just use it because it was the one i was taught . each of these terms has its own merits and faults and reflects the theory of compounding the user ascribes to , which is all well and good but it makes research in this area very difficult . another problem arising in part from or simply reflected in the plethora of terms for this type of compounds is the fact that no two linguists define the group in the same way . for some a synthetic compound can only be made up of a verbal and noun that can be interpreted as its direct object ( dishwasher , face painting ) for others the noun can be an oblique object as well ( theater goer ) and other will call any compound with a verbal element a synthetic ( examining room ) . for the purposes of my current work i am only interested in the first type ( v + do ) , in fact only the subset where the compound is understood to be a person or object that preforms the action ie . a dishwasher : something / one that washes dishes . 2 . why did i think that " driver " of " truck driver " was a " verb " it is obviously a " noun " ? why was n't i looking at the ordering of nps instead of that of vps ? admittedly at first glance the compound " truck driver " does seem to be made up of two nouns " truck " and " driver " . in fact i cannot at this point think of any compelling argument against this view except that words like " driver " tend to be semantically weak and except in a few case like that of " driver " unless they appear as part of a compound they have no meaning out of context . compare " grower " with " apple grower " . the french compounds present even better support for the verb based view . the " essuie " of " essuie-glace " ( windshield-wiper ) is a straight forward verb form . there is no french noun " essuie " ( * wiper ) thus french synthetics at least cannot be n + n compounds , and if we want a unified theory of synthetics then english synthetics cannot be n + n either . if you want to comment on either of these questions , please do so directly to linguist . i think either of them could lead to a good general debate and i have already said all i have to say about these subjects at the moment . part 2 : synthetic compound bibliography ( warning some citations are incomplete , i hope this does n't cause anyone too much trouble ) adams , valerie . an introduction to modern english word - formation . new york : longman bauer , laurie . english word formation . cambridge : cambridge university press ( 1983 ) - - - . the grammar of nominal compounding : with special reference to danish , english , and french . odense : odense university press , ( 1978 ) . beard , robert . lexeme - morpheme base morphology . suny press ( this summer ) booij , g . and t . van haaften .

" he ( nom ) wipes ( 3rd sing pres ) the ( fem sing ) glass ( fem sing ) ? elle porte la parole . " she ( nom ) carries ( 3rd sing pres ) the ( fem sing ) speech ( fem sing ) . les essuie-glaces ( pl ) no fem exists les porte-paroles ( pl ) la porte-parole ( fem ) this pattern is very productive in french especially with - er verbs . these compounds are always masculine regardless of the gender of the nominal element . " essuie " and " porte " independently can only be interpreted as verb stems of 3rd singular pres . they cannot be used as nouns or adjectives . phillipe barbaud at universite du quebec a montreal wrote a nice paper ( the name of which escapes me ) on french compounds in the late 80 's thanks again to all those who replied to my first query . i hope this summary has been of some use . heather anderson hmanders @ indiana . edu 322 memorial hall iu bloomington , in 47405
<subject> sum : x - rays and acoustic signals </subject> dear linguist members , some weeks ago i published a request for information about methods of measuring movements of the articulating organs . within this field i was especially interested in x - ray documentation and films . alice faber ( faber @ haskins . yale . edu ) wrote that " back in the 1960 's the center for applied linguistics here in the us made a set of such films of ' exotic ' languages . we have a set here at haskins , . . . " caroline smith reported on another method of measurement . she wrote that a method of measurement which works on the basis of electromagnetism was used by " the people at the institut fuer phonetik und sprachliche kommunikation der universitaet muenchen , who are the world leaders in electromagneticarticulography ( fipkm @ phonetik . uni-muenchen . de ) . " bob port ( port @ cs . indiana . edu ) from indiana reports on " x - ray microbeam data at univ of wisconsin . " and continues " there is now a large amount of material available , but is not in video form " a most interesting hint at x - ray documentation i want to give verbally at this place : kenneth r . beesley ( ken . beesley @ xerox . fr ) writes : " i have also seen x - ray movies from the eastman collection in rochester , new york . these films show , among many other things , people talking , playing musical instruments , and moving in various ways . for medical interest , there are also films of swallowing and bladder functions . i have seen some x - ray photographs of vowel-production settings from the old ussr , but these are less interesting than films . the eastman films , produced in the 1940s and early 50s , i believe , are unintentionally frightening because the doses of x - rays considered safe then were perhaps 500 times what they are now . as best i can remember , these films were somewhat inspired by x - ray films made by the nazis using inmates of concentration camps . these films , brought back to the united states after the war , were watched in fascination by eastman and his colleagues . they featured scenes with full skeletons walking about . the x - ray doses were no doubt fatal to the victims . " beesley also reports on phoneticians from the university of glasgow , scotland and members of the school of dentistry , who some eighteen years ago produced x - ray images that show people talking . helmer strike ( strik @ let . kun . nl ) delivers two methods of measuring articulation : " the technique that resembles the old x - ray films the most is called mri ( magnetic resonance imaging ) . a good article on this topic is baer et al .

<subject> summary : algonquian homeland </subject> content - length : 10189 in april i made an enquiry about the algonquian homeland of which a slightly abbreviated form is repeated below : * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * i have just been reading merritt ruhlen 's _ the origin of language _ . i would like to ask a question or two about the content of the section ' locating the algonquian homeland ' . first , ruhlen says that ' frank siebert has proposed the area of the eastern upper great lakes as the origin of the algonquian dispersal ' . ruhlen does not source his reference . can anyone give me the source ? secondly , and more importantly , ruhlen appeals to sapir 's age - area hypothesis to the effect that the area of greatest diversity in a family is likely to point to the original homeland of the family . since the greatest divergence is evidently between blackfoot and the rest of the family , in the southwest of the family 's extent , ruhlen suggests , _ contra _ siebert , that the homeland is there , and that the family 's closest external relatives are also in that direction . as an initial attempt to locate a homeland , ruhlen 's arguments seem sound enough to an outsider . however , the kind of support for them that i would want to look for would be an argument that the first branching in the genealogical tree divides blackfoot from the rest of the family . this would be based on a claim that the rest of the family shares a set of innovations relative to proto algonquian ( a proto algonquian whose reconstruction also takes full account of blackfoot data ) . i went to the library here to see what i could find , and came up with ives goddard 's account of ' comparative algonquian ' in campbell & mithun 's _ the languages of native america _ ( 1979 ) . goddard says , if i read him correctly , ( i ) that the only obvious subgroup within algonquian is eastern algonquian ( and he gives innovations defining this ) , ( ii ) that blackfoot is highly divergent and that its history is not yet understood . goddard 's account understandably does not contain the kind of data that would allow a non - algonquianist to assess ruhlen 's hypothesis . i would be grateful to anyone who could point me towards any work that would cast light on the question of algonquian subgrouping and the homeland or who could comment knowledgably on ruhlen 's homeland hypothesis . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * i would like to thank those who responded , some of them several times , and those who were generous enough to send me copies of materials i could not obtain here . they were : dan alford , peter bakker , david costa , pat crowe , marybeth culley , anthony fox , ives goddard , john koontz , phil lesourd , rob malouf , john o'meara , marc picard , karl teeter . i have n't had time yet to read the recommended references or to think carefully about the views expressed , which were varied . so varied , it seems to me , that when i set out to write a summary , i could n't , so i have resorted to extracting crucial passages from people 's messages . i hope this will not result in any misrepresentations . the siebert article is : siebert , frank . 1967 . the original home of the proto - algonquian people . a . d . deblois , contributions to anthropology : linguistics i ( algonquian ) , pp . 13-47 . national museum of canada , bulletin no . 214 , anthropological series no . 78 , ottawa several respondents drew my attention to the fact that the question of ' homeland ' is related to the question of time depth , i . e , how far back do we want to go in our search for the homeland ? one pointed out , however , that if algonquian is a subgroup of algic , then we can define the algonquian homeland as the area where proto algonquian ( a member of the algic subgroup ) was spoken , treating the algic homeland separately . ' best guess based on location ( of the algic homeland ) would be some sort of a northwest coast origin , but there is no real evidence for this . ' ' denny places the pa speakers around the upper columbia river in oregon and washington . he bases his conclusions on archaelogical evidence , the connections between pa and the larger algic language family , and on the existence of a handful of algonquian languages spoken along the northern coast of california . he proposes that the pa speakers radiated south to california and west to the great lakes ( giving us the precursors of blackfoot , cheyenne , and arapaho along the way ) . at least , i think that 's how it goes - you should really check the article . ' ' blackfoot and arapaho are the most divergent ( algonquian ) languages , and . . . thus the family probably started in the northern rockies and spread east from there . most algonquianists who think about such things these days recognize a lot of problems with siebert locating proto - algonquian in southern ontario . ives ' article ( goddard 1994 ) makes a lot of sense - - essentially the scenario is that the family came from idaho or thereabouts out onto the prairies in montana , and first dropped blackfoot . then , it continued east , dropping arapaho , cree , menominee - cheyenne , ' core central ' , and eastern algonquian . i ' m not too familiar with what archaeological support there is for this idea , but i do know there is no archaeological support for siebert 's idea ( southern ontario looks to be historically iroquoian ) . ' ' having read a number of studies by witold manczak that seem to show pretty convincingly that the more conservative languages in a family are in and around the original homeland , and the more divergent ones on the periphery , i find siebert 's hypothesis much more convincing , though i know there are legitimate algonkianists who would side with ruhlen on this . . . . i ' ve been working on algonkian for well over twenty years and i consider siebert to be one of the best algonkianists we ' ve ever had . ' ' for my own part , it seems to me probably relevant to the prehistory of algonquian that blackfoot , arapaho - atsina , and mandan ( siouan ) and hidatsa ( siouan ) are all associated with cultures that practiced rather similar age grouping systems ( similar society names , system otherwise not found in north america ) , and are located close together in the middle missouri archaeological area and points north . this region was fairly uniform culturally c . 2000 bp , and i wonder if the culture then most widespead in the area - besant - may not be the source of age grouping practice . it might also be associated with algonquian language ( s ) , though that would be impossible to prove . i think the siouan groups must have arrived somewhat later , during the development of the subsequent middle missouri tradition , but the cheyenne seem to have a middle missouri connection , and perhaps the algonquian affiliation with the middle missouri region is older . . . anyway , if besant was largely algonquian , then the existing plains algonquian groups ( not a linguistic subgroup ) , may reflect a formerly stronger algonquian presence on the northern plains . ' ' as for the position of blackfoot , i am myself of the opinion that its grammatical system is algonquian , but its lexicon is not . i know cree ( central algonquian ) reasonably well , but blackfoot remains completely unintelligible to me , although the language looks very algonquian ( unlike , for instance , gros ventre , arapaho and cheyenne - these algonquian languages are just as unintelligible , but this can be attributed to some recent ( few hundred years ago ) radical sound changes . . . . but few of these studies deal with the place of blackfoot in a comparative light . i think , simply because it is possible only to compare blackfoot and algonquian lexically . actually there are few blackfoot words ( stems ) which the algonquianists are able to link with algonquian . in my opinion . . . it is a mixed language , with a few algonquian stems , but the bulk from an unknown and otherwise extinct language families . the blackfoot stems sometimes look like algonquian backslang ( such as the word for 'd og ' ; blackfoot imita ( ua ) , plains cree atim ) . otherwise it is just impossible that the grammatical system is so close to cree whereas the lexicon is so different . but probably few hardcore algonquianists would agree .

<subject> comparative method : n - ary comparison again </subject> some time ago , while we were discussing comparative linguistics , the question was raised ( by bill poser , i think ) of whether anybody ever claims in print that binary comparison is preferable to n-ary comparison . while i cited one reference at that time , i thought it might be still be of general interest to adduce one more , which has just come to my attention . in his attack on the theory that japanese is altaic ( and on altaic as a whole ) , janhunen 1992 argues that the odds of finding apparent matches simply by chance when japanese is compared to the four altaic languages / subgroups , viz . , turkic , mongolic , tungusic , and korean , are four times as high as are the odds of finding such spurious matches when japanese is compared to just one language , specifically korean ( which is singled out by janhunen because there has been a fair amount of work on japanese - korean comparison which ignored altaic ) . in other words , janhunen assumes that a 5 - ary comparison is four times as likely to produce matches purely by chance ( what i call ' false positives ' ) as is a binary comparison . this , needless to say , is a fallacy , but there you have it . janhunen , juha . 1992 . das japanische in vergleichender sicht . journal de la soci t finno - ougrienne 84 . 145-161 .

<subject> qs : serrano and hualapai </subject> i ' m cross-posting this to linguist and endangered-languages - l , so apologies if anyone gets two of these . * * * * * question 1 : serrano language ( in san bernardino , california , united states ) i have been searching without luck for anything regarding the serrano people and especially the serrano language . i ' ve been able to find out that there remains * one * speaker of serrano left , but have had no luck so far in contacting her . you know how that goes : a knows b , who knows c , whose aunt ( d ) is the last speaker . ( these are reliable people , so i feel confident that d speaks serrano ; d 's sister , who also spoke serrano , died recently . ) i live about a mile from the san manuel indian reservation . the people there are serrano , but most just know they are " indian , " they do n't know what " tribe . " at the tribal offices , the woman i spoke to was unaware that there had ever been a serrano language . the information i have so far comes from anthropology / archaeology people and linguists working at the morongo indian reservation ( cahuilla , in banning , california , united states ) . i ' m afraid that serrano will be history within the next couple of years . does anyone know where i might find information on the serrano language or the people who once spoke it ? * * * * * question 2 : hypothetical situation d , above , is the last remaining speaker of serrano . her serrano would be an idiolect , her personal serrano language . suppose i was able to capture all of her knowledge of the language before she dies and write a descriptive grammar which was then used by others to learn serrano , and the language survived . ( would n't it be nice if things worked that way ! ) would the original idiolect then be classified as a language ? dialect ? still an idiolect ? if serrano would still be an idiolect , since my understanding of the language would most likely be slightly different than d 's , would this be * my * ideolect , or * her * idiolect ? * * * * * question 3 : hualapai language ( in peach springs , arizona , united states ) soon , i will be moving to peach springs , arizona , to the hualapai indian reservation . i will be living there for about three months . the hualapai language is still widely used in peach springs ( still a small group of people though ) , and i am going to be doing a very intensive , crash course in hualapai ( two hours per day , every day , with two native speakers , as well as basic communication with other people outside my " learning " time ) . by the end of my stay , i hope to be able to communicate with others , but i ' m pretty sure i won't completely master the language in that short amount of time . my " official job " is setting up and fixing the computer network for the school there , but i will also be developing some computer applications in hualapai ( as opposed to an english language interface like we are used to seeing ) . i will also be working with the two native speakers to produce a few books written in hualapai . in addition to these books , i am going to try to translate some public-domain children 's classics , for example _ the wonderful wizard of oz _ , to help me with learning the language , as well as providing great stories for the kids there . i also plan on writing a journal of my learning of the hualapai language ( adult l2 acquisition study ) . i am a self-taught , amateur linguist - - i . e . , i read a lot and pester people with questions . the only formal education i have is a 10 - week course in ( english ) language acquisition by children . my question is , is there any interest outside the hualapai reservation for the software , books , or journal ? the books will be printed and we will need to know how many copies to print ( i . e . , just for use at the school , or extras for other people , too ) . a new edition of the hualapai grammar has been finished ( the old edition is 8 - 1 / 2 x 11 , 575 pages ; i have n't seen the new one yet ) , but not gone to the printers yet , and a dictionary is in the making . the software and journal can be duplicated as needed , but the books can be printed with title vii funds ( government money ) if they are for use at the school only , but we will have to make other funding arrangements if the books are to be sold to people outside the school . is anyone interested ? * * * * * fyi i developed a font for typing in hualapai . it is * not * intended to be a general-purpose , one-size - fits-all font , it is intended to allow rapid typing in hualapai . the font is a times typeface . currently , i have truetype and postsrcipt versions for ibm-pc compatible computers , and in the near future , macintosh versions of truetype and postscript fonts will be available . the sil ( summer institute of linguistics ) and a couple of sites in germany have offered me space on their ftp computers for the font . any other ftp sites would be appreciated . when i get the fonts uploaded , i ' ll post addresses to the lists . the font is " postcard-ware , " i . e . , it is free , but you have to send us a postcard from your hometown . : - ) * * * * * as is usual , i will post summaries of answers to my questions to the list if there is sufficient interest . thanks for wading through this long-winded message . chuck coker cjcoker @ csupomona . edu ccoker @ igc . apc . org

<subject> 6 . 524 german affricates </subject> i may have missed some of the discussion on this matter when i was away for a couple of weeks , but i want to throw in one item if it has n't been in already . in english at least the phonetic distinction between a palatoalveolar afffricate and an alveolar stop + palatoalveolar fricative is patent and unproblematic . in pairs like catch it vs . cat shit ratchet vs . rat shit it is easy to hear the difference , even if the prosodic patterns are the same . in the first ( let 's call it / c ^ / case , the stop segment is not alveolar but palatoalveolar , and short , and the whole two-quality sequence is about the length of an initial voiceless stop ; in the second , let 's call it / ts / cluster , the / t / is more alveolar , a bit retracted but without as much laminal contact , and the length of the sequence is like the length of a cluster , i . e . the stop onset is not ' ovbershort ' , as it is in the first case . i wonder if the distinction in german is more or less the same ? roger lass university of cape town

<subject> possessives </subject> i ' ve been away for awhile , but i just came back and checked my email , finding benji wald 's speculative comments on _ of 's _ constructions , dated may 20th , the linguist list . i just want to say one thing : way to go , benji ! ! i think it 's great that my question and summary can have led to such great and interesting ruminating on an admittedly poorly-understood area of the english language . as i wrote to another interested party , i hope that this whole thing has opened up a great big can of worms , the messier the better . i ' m just vindictive enough to love seeing formalist theories smashed to smithereens by real language data , and just crazy enough to love the chaos . i 'd love to see more comments put out on the list by anyone with even a passing interest in the matter and a few baffling examples they can't explain . just to further the matter a little , i 'd like to comment on something in benji wald 's article ? ( installment ? memo ? hmmm . . . . what do we call serial email things like this ? ) he wrote : > a friend of john 's ( inhale ) wife = ? ? one of john 's friends ' wife > > / and i ' m starting to dislike the last example on the right . / > > i do n't think position of inhale really helps , well , maybe if you > know whether i ' m asthmatic or not ( is that how you spell it in > english ? ) > also note in passing that another irregular plural can take a bow for > doing something useful , > > one of john 's wife 's friends vs . one of john 's wives ' ( ? ? es ) friends > > cntr . one of john 's significant other 's ( / others ' ( ? ? es ' ) friends > > ( and once again : yeah , but if you say it . . . ) > > but then again , what 's the difference between : > one of john 's friends ' ( . . . ) wife and one of john 's friends ' > wives > ( i mean given current anglophonic customs ) , except that we can > formally reduce the latter to > one of the wives > but not the former to > one of the wife > / that 's why i do n't like " one of john 's friends ' wife " / i think i understand why he does n't like _ one of john 's friends ' wife _ - - it 's because it sounds funny if we have the abbreviated phonological form [ . . . djanz frenz wayf ] . but , if we add in another / z / to " friends ' " , it seems to sound better ( even more so with modification ) : 1 ) one of john 's long-time friends 's [ frenz . z ] wife is evil . however , 2 ) the wife of one of john 's ( long-time ) friends 's is evil . sounds better than either to me . but here 's something for the experts . in sentence ( 2 ) above , i feel an almost irresistable urge to steal the final / z / from " friends 's " and put it on " john 's " , which would leave the sentence : 2 ' ) the wife of one of john 's 's [ djanz . z ] long-time friends is evil . which , funny as it looks in print , is the most grammatical-sounding sentence so far , as far as i ' m concerned . in ( 2 ' ) , the wife has to be the friend 's , of course , and not john 's , so why is " john " able to get the / z / ? signed , another ( happily ) flustered linguist .
<subject> re : 6 . 775 , syldavian tutorial </subject> there is one ( at least ) translation of the oldest syldavian text , which our first tutorial ommitted . ihave waited to long to refer interested readers to my sources , but it is an inevitable work for those interested as much in syldavian as in bordurian . it comes from frederic soumois ' dossier tintin : sources , versions , themes , structures , jacques antoine , 1987 . it shows how much herge used brussels french and flemish roots in every language he " devised " in his works . for example , pace guy who adopted herge 's own suggestion of translation of " eih bennek , eih blavek " by " qui s ' y frotte s ' y pique " ( roughly , " whoever rubs himself against it will get stung by it " ) , it looks more like dutch " hier ben ik , hier blijf ik " , meaning " here i am , here i stay " . the translation soumois proposes for the xivth century manuscript goes approximately like this ( i won't bother to go into the etymological details , and i won [ t try to reproduce the original text : " father ottokar , thou art then king of [ the city / poland ? ] , then the trone is for me " . that one says to the other : " come get the sceptre " . and the king stroke staszrvich with the sceptre , and the nanny-goat [ ? ] fell on the floor / was left on the field . " i also recommend , as an example of l2 morphology , the excellent passage in borduria that one can find in the french version of " the calculus affair " ( l ' affaire tournesol ) , unfortunately absent in the english version , and hopefully to be found again in the german version , if i can get it ( and probably not in the chinese version ) . there are also short passages of linguistic interest in destination moon and explorers on the moon , and , for arumbaya , in tintin and the broken ear . any useful or absolutely useless information welcome . richard desrochers

<subject> neurophysiology and written language </subject> i would be grateful for references to recent research that would fall under the category of neurophysiology . does anyone know of studies on aphasic or other kinds of patients who are trying to recover fluency in the use of language by using computers to communicate with therapists , caretakers , or doctors ? the focus of this type of research should be on the strengthening of neural networks through the use of computers by sending and receiving messages . it could also involve performing specific types of exercises that stress writing as opposed to speech . your assistance will be greatly appreciated . please reply to sotillo @ apollo . montclair . edu

<subject> sum : ' this ' and ' that ' </subject> dear colleagues : last week i sent a query to this list asking you about the fomral opposition between ' this ' and ' that ' in the demonstratives ( june 4 , 6 . 772 , qs : ' this ' , . . . ) . i have received 26 responses by now , and so think it necessary to compile a quick summary today as i will be away from tokyo for more than two weeks starting tomorrow . the original text of my query was as follows : some present-day ' european ' languages have only one set of simple demonstratives and the opposition of ( this ) vs . < that > is expressed by the help of ( here ) and < there > : french ceci ' this ' ce livre-ci ' this book ' cela ' that ' ce livre-l ` a ' that book ' swedish det ha " r ' this ' den ha " r bilen ' this car ' det da " r ' that ' den da " r bilen ' that car ' estonian see siin ' this ' see maja siin ' this house ' see seal ' that ' see maja seal ' that house ' my sweidish - german dictionary ( stora tyska ordboken ) gives ( der hier ) and ( der da ) as colloquial ( familia " r , umgangssprachlich ) german forms which conrrespond to ( den ha " r ) and < den da " r > , respectively . how common is a demonstrative system like this ? incidentally , japanese has a rather sophisticated three-way distinction here : kono hon ' this book ( you see here ) ' sono hon ' that book ( you see there ) , the book ( under discussion ) ' ano hon ' that book ( you see over there ) ' so i ' m afraid i will have to convince my students that the japanese are extravagant even in the way of using demonstratives . though the last paragraph was intended as an allusion to the way japanese tourists spend money overseas , quite a few people , both japanese and non - japanese , took it seriously and tried to convince me that the japanese language ( sic ! ) was by no means " extravagant " because it was not alone in having a three-way distinction in the demonstratives . some even drew my attention to the existence of a language with a five-way distinction . i thank them for the examples of various demonstrative systems they sent me , but this is not the point i wanted to discuss . perhaps i should have stated explicitly that i was interested in the morphology of demonstrative pronouns / adjectives . it is very important that french , for instance , has one basic demonstrative pronoun-adjective , i . e . ( ce ) , on the morph-lexical level , and that the speaker of french may optionally add an element meaning either ( here ) or < there > in order to make finer distinctions ( ce livre-ci , cette table-l ' a ) . in japanese , however , there 's no single basic demonstrative pronoun-adjective like ( ce ) in french : the speaker of japanese must always choose one from the set of three lexically distinct demonstrative forms . this is a big difference , and puzzels many of my students in my estonian syntax class . here are the responses which i think have direct relevance to my interest : - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - i imagine that your posting was a bit abbreviated , so did not mention the swedish demonstratives denna / detta / dessa and den / det / de , which in any case are grammatically correct but not usual in conversational speech ( " den tiden , " " det aaret , " " de fraagorna " ) . one would expect danish and norwegian to be similar in this regard to swedish , but unfortunately i have little information to contribute . while danish does has both den / det / de and so on plus the option of adding " der " ( " tag den bog , " " naer saa du de mennesker ? " ; " hvad er det der ? " , " jeg tager dem ( der ) " ) , i ' m not certain whether usage is quite the same , that is , whether the " den der " forms predominate as they do in swedish . [ . . . ] certain dialects of american english do use " this here " and " that there , " as attested by the way schoolteachers warn their students not to use those expressions . they ' re nonstandard and are regarded as uneducated usages , though i suspect that they actually come from older dialects of british descent in which they were acceptable . - - brian white ( bfwhite @ watson . ibm . com ) - - the use of compund demonstratives is indeed common in my own mother tongue , norwegian , and i believe in all ' scandinavian ' languages , ie norwegian , danish and swedish . i feel that it is a feature of colloquial speech , and i would be surprised to find it in ( formal ) writing . in fast speech the distinction between the two demonstratives tends to be lost , at least in my own dialect ( bergen , western norway ) : den her bilen - - - - ) 'd enner bilen ' ( this car ) den der bilen - - - - ) 'd enner bilen ' ( that car ) moreover , norwegian ( and , i believe , swedish + danish ) has the distinctions : den bilen vs denne bilen ( that car vs this car ; masc . ) det huset vs dette huset ( that house vs this house ; neu . ) which seem to correspond closely to this / that in english , and are perfectly acceptable in written and spoken norwegian . - - gisle andersen ( gisle . andersen @ eng . uib . no ) - - as a native speaker , i would not really use ( der hier ) even colloquial , ( der da ) is possible , an would more likely contrast with < der dort > , which implies that ( der da ) goes along with < this > and not with < that > ! but in general : it is always a problem for native speakers of german to acquire the this / that distinction , as we do not draw the same boundaries . maybe , a more formal ( in terms of the register ) would be : ( dieses ) ( this ) and < jenes > ( that ) - - this it at least what i use in translations ( and also what my german / english dictionary advises me to do - but never trust a dictionary ) . actually , we do not use ( jenes ) very much , it goes along with very formal speech and maybe even old - fashioned . - - gertraud benke ( gertraud @ leland . stanford . edu ) - - english colloquially , esp . black eng . vernacular , uses ' this here ' and ' that there . ' ' this book here ' vs . ' this book there ' sounds perfectly normal , while ' this here book ' and ' that there book ' sound mostly like american english from the south-east portion of the u . s . - - tim beasley ( tbeasley @ ucla . edu ) - - you might be interested to know that many dialects of english ( appalachian us , and therefore some british dialects as well ) have a similar opposition to the one you ' re talking about : this here dog that there dog there is more than one demonstrative used , but the " here " and " there " seem to be relics of some old germanic usage . - - james kirchner ( jpkirchner @ aol . com ) - - in some dialects of british english ( i ' m not excluding other varieties but i do n't know them well enough ) ' this here ' and ' that there ' are perfectly acceptable eg ' look at this here postcard that she sent me ' ' pick up that there bucket ' these are normal in my dialect - - david britain ( dbritain @ essex . ac . uk ) - - there is another funny case . in colloquial english , you can say " this here x " and " that there x " . in greek , there is " afto edho " ( usually pronounced " aftodho " ) and " ekino eki " ( " ekinoki " ) with the same meaning .

<subject> mac parallel concordancer available </subject> before christmas i sent a message to the list about a mac concordance program called monoconc . that program is now available as monoconc . hqx from the ftp site at rice university . to retrieve the program , ftp to ftp . rice . edu and connect to the directory pub / ling . monoconc is a spin-off of another program i have been working on , which is paraconc . paraconc is a concordance program that works with parallel texts , i . e . , two texts ( translations ) that have been aligned so that sentence number n ( or linguistic unit n ) in language a is lined up with sentence n in language b . paraconc itself does not do any alignment ; hence the texts must be aligned manually ( i . e . , with a word processor ) or by using another program . once each text is loaded into the program , a search can be performed . as with monoconc , a word , part-of - word , or phrase can be entered . the program produces a numbered key-word - in-context concordance based on the occurrence of the search term in text a . a second window displays the sentences in text b that contain the translations of the concordance lines . the concordance lines can be sorted 1l or 1r and the results can be saved or printed . i am making paraconc available to the academic community as a standalone shareware program . i would be happy to receive corpora ( parallel or single ) in exchange . corpora for our use at rice university or for distribution to a wider community are all welcome . paraconc is available by ftp from ftp . rice . edu in the directory pub / ling . the program ( on a disk ) and manual can be purchased from athelstan ( 800-598 - 3880 ) . questions , complaints , and requests for different versions of the software can be sent to me . i am also interested in making contact with other linguists working or thinking about working with parallel texts for research and language teaching . michael barlow dept of linguistics rice university barlow @ ruf . rice . edu

<subject> feminine-he , singular-they </subject> content - length : 8133 dear language scholars . i am presenting the following material as a discussion item . one of my ultimate purposes is to contribute to the revised oed due out in 2005 . for a paper i am currently working on , i ' m requesting comments and contributions . a summary will be forthcoming . feminine-he and singular-they mine is a new set of explanations for the two most regularly discussed grammatical oddities of english : indefinite / proverbial he and singular they . ( i will also touch on them and their . ) the orthodox view of pronoun history ( for she , they , them , their ) involves the north-to - south " wave theory , " as stated as early as 1866 by richard morris . it is the theory that is set forth in the oed and has never been questioned . the feminine h - stem , according to this accepted view , was displaced in the language in a wave of cultural diffusion when the feminine pronunciation began to approximate that of the masculine pronoun in the 12th and 13th centuries . the other pronouns discussed here also involved the north-to - south waves of diffusion . my contention is that the significant cause for the historical replacement of these pronouns ( except for the h - stem subject plural ) was the standardizing force exerted by the printing press - - it happened rather quickly - - not waves of cultural diffusion over centuries . in my analysis of the seventeen manuscripts of the a - version of piers plowman , the h - stem feminine is found with great regularity . how can this be explained ? in many lines , the occurrences in the manuscripts of h - stem feminines outnumber the sh - forms found in the same lines . many manuscripts use both forms . the manuscripts are copies of copies of copies . on the bases of the manuscripts that have been dated , i place the " average " manuscript within a few generations of the advent of printing . my explanation , perhaps the anglo - norman rulers had a predilection for a distinction in the masculine / feminine singular . while the folk generally used the bi-gendric " egalitatian " h - stem form in the vernacular , the more politically correct sh - form was preferred at oxford / cambridge , in proper social etiquette , and in writing when referring to a " lady . " when caxton began his enterprise , the sh - form ( as well as the others spoken of here ) became enforced as the correct form through the great power of the press . and the h - stem feminine remained known in the spoken language , alongside the sh - form , well beyond printing . it had not dropped from speech and become archaic by 1300 . when the " prescriptive " grammarians prescribed indefinite-he , this h - stem still carried in its semantic domain a bi-gendric reference . although the seventeen manuscripts of piers is my main corpus of evidence , there are various kinds of other evidence to support my theory for the late survival of the h - stem feminine in the colloquial of the middle ages . one of the more interesting is the existence of the h - stem feminine in gullah ( when and if west african origins are discounted ) . other supporting evidence can be found in various places in the oed . it is scanty and scattered , but nonetheless there . h - stem and sh - form feminines existed for centuries , side by side , as formal and informal , although , for sure , in many cases the distinction was lost . " hi was a fair wifman " is found in the mid - 14th century agenbite of inwyt ( i am currently translating this work ) . in it , the pronunciation of the feminine pronoun is the same as the modern masculine ! ( the vowel had not yet diphthongized ) . the supposition that this h - stem is a " literary form , " as suggested by the oed ( presumably this means copied in manuscript from an earlier exemplar ) is untenable because the agenbite was translated directly from french . i have extracted the pronoun paradigms from all the manuscripts of the a - version of piers . in addition to the great evidence for the wide use of the h - stem feminine centuries beyond its supposed demise , the h - stem plural ( although extremely rare ) can also be found ( in line prologue 63 it is used to satisfy alliteration ! ) . and in every manuscript of piers the h - stem obliques ( modern them and their ) are to be found ( often alongside the th - forms ) . and then , in a generation after printing , the h - stems for she , they , them , and their seem to vanish ! ! , at least from the written evidence . the h - stem feminine held wide currency in the colloquial of the middle ages and therefore , supported by other evidence , was not unknown to the prescriptive grammarians a few centuries later . the accepted theory that the h - stem feminine dropped from the language before 1300 , prior to the time the poem " alysoun " was written , is in need of revision . piers shows it to have been very much alive in the 15th century . an explanation for the replacement of the h - stem plural nominative by they , a replacement occurring earlier than the other pronouns in question , has never been proposed . would n't there have been pressure for some alternative to the oe h - stem subject plural as a result of the disappearance of the preterit plural during this period ? because the english verb lost its marker in the preterit for number , the h - stem plural ( which shared the same form with the feminine singular nominative ) became in some contexts ambiguous for number . a new form was needed . although a norse form may have reinforced it among northern speakers , there was a native singular form available from the same set of oe demonstratives that gave us the . the and they appear to be duplets . if this is so , then the singular morphology of they is in fact historical and has been alive in the colloquial for a very long time ! ! the , in oe a singular , developed as a singular / plural ( the car / cars ) , extended to the accusative , but lost its absolute ( stand-alone ) use . they , retaining the pronunciation of oe the , was restricted to the nominative , and became the unambiguous written plural by 1400 - - but in the colloquial it retained also its singular morphology . later , in regard to them and their , caxton used the th - forms as the unambiguous plurals because the h - stems for these pronouns had throughout england a tremendous diversity of forms . for example , in one ( written ) dialect her would be a feminine / singular / possesive , in another it would be an all-genders / plural / possesive . caxton needed forms that would be universally understood , hence the written th - form obliques replaced the h - stems in an historic blink of the eye - - not in a wave of cultural diffusion that coincidentally wafted through london at the time caxton set up his print shop . a well supported case can be made for the late survival of the h - stem feminine , into the 15th century , and hence a case for its cultural currency at the time of the prescriptive grammarians . if this is so , the exclusion of one gender from " cognitive space " would not apply , and hence the motives of these grammarians would have to be reassessed . if in fact the sapir - whorf hypothesis does apply to pronouns , then i invite comment to help me understand two facts . 1 ) that for two-thirds of the history of english the subject pronoun used to refer to a group of men / boys was a form that was identical to the feminine singular ; and 2 ) the expression by a pronoun of " possessing " something by men / boys was also for two-thirds of the history of english expressed by a form that was morphologically marked for feminine but not masculine .
<subject> q : " english only " </subject> content - length : 1562 my recent query on wwi era suppression of german in iowa has brought up another issue . many in the linguistics field commonly use a term " english only " by which they mean a movement whose members ( many of whom are non-native english speakers ) refer to themselves as the " official english movement " . to me the term " english only " , possibly intentionally , implies a total ban on the use of any other language . the only proposed " official english " amendment i ' ve seen is the one proposed by the organization u . s . english . it stated very clearly that it was not to be construed as restricting the use of languages other than english in private life , daily business affairs , or in situations in which the speaker 's safety is at stake . i ' ve also seen polls , particularly from california , that claim that anywhere from 60 % to 85 % of various immigrant groups , that would be affected by such an amendment , actually favor one , in direct opposition to activist groups claiming to represent them . i can't imagine people favoring an " english only " amendment that would place a total ban on use of their native languages . leaving aside the blanket idea that " life is politics , " can anyone tell me of a recent case ( say , in the last 30 years ) in which a law that would completely ban use of languages other than english has come up for a vote somewhere in the u . s . ? i do n't think it 's impossible . i 'd just like to see one , if there have been any . james kirchner

<subject> ape language </subject> the latest issue of the journal of nih research ( vol 7 , no . 1 jan . 1995 pp . 50-55 ) contains a short review article by pat shipman on human evolution . on the cover , the article is referred to as " fading lines between apes and humans , " but actually it is titled " climbing the family tree : what makes a hominid a hominid ? " . the discussion on linguistic abilities might be of interest to other subscribers to the linguist list . the author discusses kanzi and sue savage - rumbaugh 's 1994 book " kanzi : the ape at the brink of the human mind , " [ john wiley and sons , ny ] . according to savage - rumbaugh , kanzi does have a rudimentary grammar , can use displaced referents and arbitrary symbols ( in this case , icons or " lexigrams " on a computer ) . s - r thinks his ability equals that of a 2 year old child . in later section , the work of derek bickerton ( " language and species , " 1990 [ university of chicago press ] is summarized . bickerton admits that kanzi , other apes and young children use " proto-language , " but not full language because of the lack if grammatical elements . most of the rest of the section on language is devoted to broca 's area and cortical specialization . - - john

<subject> summary : half a day </subject> dear readers , many thanks to all respondents ( 51 ) who sent replies to my query about time phrases and native-speaker judgments . there were too many replies to acknowledge individually . many of you asked for a summary , so here goes . # # = strongly preferred , # = good , ? = awkward , x = bad , yuck the figures following each phrase give the number of votes cast in each category . they do n't all add up to 51 because some respondents ( rs ) expressed only their first preference . # # # ? x 1 the family spent . . . . . . . in ipswich . a . a day and a half 24 26 0 0 b . one and a half days 1 31 7 7 c . thirty-six hours 1 29 6 9 this makes [ a ] a clear winner , but for many rs [ b ] and [ c ] are acceptable , too , depending on context . comments : a . implies enough time to socialize ; implies most of sunday spent in ipswich , leaving at noon on monday b . implies ipswich was part of a series of visits ; implies an overnight stay ; part of a list ; stilted c . military / aeronautical ; whirlwind tour ; every moment packed with feverish activity ; at a conference - one and a half days spent on syntax ; working under time pressure ; airplane layover / waystation ; ok for negative experiences ( flu / jail ) . ( i take it a ' layover ' is us for british 's topover ' , or maybe it 's a stopover with a visit to a girlfriend ? ) 2 . it took me . . . . . . . . to write the book . a . six months 16 34 0 0 b . a half-year 0 10 9 25 c . half a year 3 44 1 1 while there is a preference for [ a ] , [ c ] is not far behind . [ b ] is problematic . comments : a . feels shorter ; not as much effort required as ' half a year ' b . suggests an academic half-year ; yuck , unnatural ; sounds non-native or british ( from american rs ) ; sounds american ( from british rs ) ; ok in financial contexts - a half year is either the first or second half , not an arbitrary 6 month period c . sounds longer than six months ; emphatic , with stress on ' year ' - 3 we ' ll be leaving in . . . . . . . a . half an hour 6 44 0 0 b . a half-hour 2 24 10 11 [ a ] wins . [ b ] splits people into two roughly equal camps . comments : b . sounds formal ; awkward ; funny ; sounds normal - we ' ll be leaving inna haf our ( from now ) . 4 tom worked for . . . . . . . . . in a lab a . a year and a half 13 37 1 0 b . one and a half years 0 32 6 7 c . eighteen months 3 39 6 0 while [ a ] wins , the other two are n't so far behind . comments : a . least exact . b . more exact ; part of calculation ( eg for pension ) ; stilted ; fussy . c . most exact ; emphasizes duration ; ok for children 's ages upto two years ; ok in contexts where precision is required ; suggests tom was less involved in the job ; maybe a temporary job . using months for time greater than a year , and hours for time greater than a day makes the time seem more rushed ; half an inch is ok but not half a foot , but half a yard is ok if bying cloth even though we do n't normally speak of half a yard . the overall impression that i get is that context and pragmatic considerations determine which lexical item will be acceptable in any given slot , and even then there is considerably more tolerance for some expressions than i would have thought possible / probable . three rs said all eleven phrases are 100 % ok . i have n't given details of rs ' background / nationality etc , since not all rs gave me details . however , about three-quarters of replies came from the usa . i hope this has been of some interest . many thanks for your response . roger maylor dept of linguistics and english language university of durham , uk

<subject> re : 6 . 797 , comparative method : n - ary comparison </subject> content - length : 1653 i , too , had noted that there seemed to be two notions of comparison here , but unlike scott delancey i did not assume that there we should distinguish between comparison for the sake of building a reconstruction and simply for the sake of determining possible relationship . to my mind , the numbers that jacques guy posted demonstrate , not the weakness of n-ary comparison , but its strength : if we are looking at a grouping of languages of which we are uncertain of relationships , and the number of potential n-way cognates is as low as random chance would dictate , then the likelihood is against their being closely-enough related to pursue reconstruction . i think this answers , by the bye , david powers ' perhaps rhetorical question regarding the assumptions under which janhunen 's claims could be considered a fallacy . i ' m not quite sure how to address powers ' conclusions , however . the methods of comparison most of us accept have built into them a checking mechanism , such that acceptance of some set of matches as " true " ( in powers ' terms ) constrains the set of further matches we can accept : what he considers to be " false " matches may not , under these constraints , be treated as matches at all . under this methodology , n-way comparison * does * increase the ratio of signal to noise in the data . i do not have access to janhunen 's original statements . if alexis manaster - ramer has summarized them accurately , i have to conclude either that janhunen is unfamiliar with the actual workings of the comparative method , or that the conclusion summarized by amr is disingenuous in the extreme - - and is indeed a fallacy , either way . rich alderson
<subject> re : 6 . 797 , comparative method : n - ary comparison </subject> critics of manaster ramer miss the main point : janhunen calls by " similarities " parallels between japanese and other altaic languages based on regular phonetic correspondences without bothering to prove that these are real " look - alikes " . the parallels based on regular correspondences are not chance or random parallels and therefore the proposed statistical games do not apply to the case . if you do not believe it , take any pair of a priori unrelated languages , such as for example mandarin and eskimo , and try to establish regula r phonetic correspondences . needless to say , adding to this company zulu , basque , and nivx is not going to " improve " the picture . alexander vovin avvovin @ miamiu . acs . muohio . edu
<subject> re : 6 . 797 , comparative method : n - ary comparison </subject> gotcha ! there are two separate fallacies in the argument against n-ary comparison which i discussed recently and which powers , delancey , and guy are now apparently seeking to defend . ( 1 ) janhunen says that the probability of a match occurring purely by chance when you compare japanese with four languages is four times what it is when you compare it with one language . this simply cannot be true because probabilities are values between 0 and 1 . if the probablity in the case of a binary comparison was say . 5 , then he would be predicting that it would be 2 in the case of n-ary comparison , which is impossible , because 2 is not between 0 and 1 . ( 2 ) the other fallacy is not purely mathematical , although i suspect that it involves elements of confusio . in any case , no one who argues for n-ary comparison ever talks about getting a match in 2 out of n languages . now , if we look at guy 's numbers , in his scenario of a 100 - word list with no shifted meanings , he came up with 14 . 5 probable spurious mathces in a binary comparison but only 5 . 8 when you are looking for a match between 3 out of 5 languages , 0 . 13 when you look for one between 4 out of 5 , and he does not give the much smaller number yet in the case of 5 out of 5 . i am not sure how jacques defines spurious and so i have not verified the numbers , but they are certainly on the right orders of magnitude . as you consider more and more languages ( also as the initial probability of a match declines , which usually happens as you go from toy models to real data ) , what happens is that you need fewer and fewer out of the n languages being compared to agree . thus , in guy 's example a match between n - 2 languages out of 5 was less likely to occur by chance than one between 2 out of 2 . but if n were 100 , i . e . , you were comparing 100 languages , then you would not need n - 2 ( i . e . , 98 ) languages to agree to be able to do better than with a binary comparison . it would be many many fewer ( although i do n't know how many since i do not know what formula jacques is using and what he is assuming about the initial probability of a match ) . maybe , he could kindly supply the numbers . and in light of all this , let us add another argument for rejecting indo - european : bopp never offered a mathematical demonstration that the relationships he proposed were unlikely to be due to chance , much less by doing a binary comparison of every pair of indo - european languages . which i think just goes to show how unrealistic the whole idea of doing such comparisons is . but if you do want to do them , then at least let us be clear about how to do them so as to minimize false positives ( i . e . matches due to chance and not really reflective of common origin ) as well as false negatives ( i . e . , failures to find genuine historical connections ) . on the second point , there are arguments that n-ary is better . alexis mr

<subject> genderless ? </subject> content - length : 350 in some languages which are standarly described as genderless it is still the case , i am pretty sure , that people say things like ' that woman ' instead of 's he ' and because this looks like a purely lexical matter , the appearance of genderlessness is preserved . i wonder if this applies to the languages recently described as genderless on this list .

<subject> genderless lgs </subject> content - length : 2009 hi you gender people , it may be that i have missed something that has been going on on the list . if i understand right there has been some claim about that a language totally lacking a gender system would be something of science fiction . as the responses have shown , this is not definitely the case but an indo - european line of thinking of what are natural conceptual ( grammatical ? ) categories . albert ortmann , among others , made the point that e . g . uralic languages generally lack gender . this is a point in case in finnish . the language does not have any grammatical gender markers ( in principle , no articles ) , no division into male / female in the pronoun system and , in particular , spoken finnish does not make distinction between animate / inanimate . persons , animals , objects , ideas may be referred to with the pronoun " se " . yet a slight comment to ortmann 's theory about case / gender . the point about case being realized only once in an np does not seem conceivable , at least from finnish point of view : attribute ( s ) and head must concord in case . hope this is of interest . and i could point out that i am no uralic or fennic scholar but a native speaking linguist . best regards - jan lindstrom dept . of scandinavian lgs university of helsinki

) : katherine ) woolard . she mentioned that in the california " official ) english " push not only were many hispanics in favor of the ) proposed legislation , but so were many supposed liberals in ) the san francisco area . she was doing an analysis of ) discourse in which such liberals justified their positions , ) showing that they were based on hidden assumptions that ) actually ran counter to their claimed liberal beliefs . all this ) points up the fact that oppressed people , with the help of ) their well-meaning supporters , often participate in their own ) oppression . indeed , historical examples indicate that such is ) true even to the point that oppressed groups help organize ) extermination of their own members for oppressing groups . ) so , the results of the polls you cite are not so transparently ) meaningful . a respondent or two drew conclusions from the oft-mentioned hysterical tone of the fundraising materials put out by the " official english " movement . my own thoughts on that , as sent to one respondent : on tue , 13 jun 1995 jpkirchner @ aol . com wrote : ) i ' m convinced there is a certain style to fundraising letters ) that crosses the political spectrum , especially since a lot of ) organizations certainly have their letters written by direct ) marketing agencies that are probably not affiliated with any ) particular persuasion . i get such letters from political ) campaigns on the left , right , and in between , including the ) democratic party , and i see absolutely the same nauseatingly > hysterical , hateful style in all of them , as if they were ) written by the same hand . ( which they sometimes may ) have been . ) in one letter , the boogie man is " liberals who ) want to take away your freedom , " in another it 's " advocates ) for the rich who want to make you homeless , " in another it 's ) immigrants , in a third it 's jingoists . the common ) denominator is always the angry , hateful tone they ' re ) written in . having worked at an ad agency , i know that the ) people in them know their targets , and just how to caress ) them or zing their fillings to get them to act . it has to be an ) established fundraising technique . this whole issue seems to me to be a mix of radical hysteria on both sides , mixed with legitimate questions , which neither side appears willing to address . since linguists , to my experience , are generally terrific at preaching linguistic tolerance , but do n't often deal with pragmatic questions that do n't affect them personally , i ' ll annoy you all with a few questions brought up by non-linguists i know . these people are neither radical conservatives , nor bothered by the use of other languages or dialects in their presence . 1 . how come in us regions where other foreign language groups outnumber hispanics , are safety warnings and federal signage are still only posted in spanish and english ? 2 . a manager , who had previously not minded foreign languages being spoken in the office , is suddenly noticing a lot of discord , backbiting and insubordination among the employees . these are hard enough to quell when everyone is speaking english , but it 's even harder for this manager to monitor what 's happening , because it 's all going on in a foreign language . does the manager a . ) sign up for a beginning language course , b . ) quit the job and give it to someone fluent in the other language , c . ) recruit some of the employees as " spies " , d . ) mandate english , e . ) other _ _ _ _ _ ? if the manager mandates english , will it qualify as linguistic intolerance in this case ? 3 . why should a child who speaks black american english be accommodated in the classroom by court order , while an appalachian kid gets forced to learn ( later changed to " gets the benefit of learning " ) the standard dialect ( i . e . , in addition to his or her own ) ? 4 . " the typists in our company are so incompetent at standard english that even a simple business letter takes them at five drafts , and one whole day , to get into acceptable form . it always comes out in their dialect , and it 's much easier for everybody to do their own typing . why can't they give these people english tests ? " these are linguistic and political questions to these people , to which i have no ready answers . what do other linguists say ? james kirchner
<subject> dislocations </subject> content - length : 4400 - - - - - - - - - - forwarded message - - - - - - - - - - date mon , 19 jun 1995 08 : 10 : 48 - 0400 > from aaa552 @ agora . ulaval . ca subject / graviton / einstein / aaa552 / mail / bb i posted a week ago a query on the topic of dislocation . i wanted to know whether just any of the phenomena known by the name of dislocation implies coreference . the responses to the posting indicated that the word dislocation is by and large used to refer to a phrase p adjoined to a sentence s where p holds a coreference relationship with a pronoun included in s . so there seems to exist a terminological consensus on this notion ( although for some dislocation covers topicalization ) . here is a very slightly edited summary of responses . many thanks to all those whose responded . i hope this is useful . pierre larrivee . w . croft @ manchester . ac . uk ( bill croft ) : i think you will have to define " dislocation " to get a useful answer from your query - - - in particular , define it in such a way that the coreference relation does not follow by definition . if " dislocation " means what the etymology suggests , then it involves movement of an element out of its canonical position ; if you allow coreference to phonologically null elements ( left in canonical position ) , then by definition a dislocated element will have a coreference relation to an element in the sentence to which it is adjoined , namely to the null or non-null element it has " left behind " . if you do not allow coreference to phonologically null elements , then the english construction called " topicalization " or " y - movement " is a counterexample to the generalization you are inquiring about . if you define " dislocation " in a non-movement fashion - - - i . e . as some element ( an np ? ) adjoined to a sentential constituent - - - then japanese , chinese and other e asian languages ' topic constructions will be a counter - example , since the " topic " np need not be an argument or even an adjunct of the sentence to which it is adjoined . to this comment of mine : it seems to me that topicalization is a somewhat different phenomena from dislocation , is it not ? cf . the prosody ( no pause for topics ) and the lack ( in general ) of a resumptive pronoun ( chocolate cake i like ( * it ) ) . w . croft added : prosody would be an interesting start on a definition of dislocation that does n't presuppose coreference - - - i think the resumptive pronoun part is more problematic , since specifying the form of a resumptive form would presuppose coreference . > from holleb @ linguist . umass . edu ( ? ? bart holle ) at the moment i am working on right dislocation , mainly in dutch . and as far as i can tell there are no counterexamples . the moment there is no reference to an element in the " main " clause it is clearly extraposition . a main difference for dutch is that you can extract out of an extraposed phrase , whereas you cannot out of right dislocated one . > from sophie . kern @ mrash . fr ( sophie kern ) i ' m actually writting my thesis about the development of narrative competence by french monolingual children ( 3 to 11 years old using ) a picture book task . one of the domain i ' m studying is the reference to the main or other characters of the story , and particulierly what kind of linguistic devices the children use to maintain or to switch reference in subject position i found a lot of left and right dislocations . > from larry horn ( lhorn @ yalevm . cis . yale . edu ) you might want to check out an old paper by robert rodman on topicalization and ld in a journal called papers in linguistics . i think it was 1973 . he talks about sentences like : as for noxious odors , my sheepdog farts after eating escargots . in which the sentence is a comment on the topic in the " ld " phrase , but no coreference per se obtains . > from barrett @ zelig . cs . nyu . edu ( leslie barrett ) there 's an article by bowers in li ( 1993 ) that mainly concerns predication but mentions coreference possibilities in fronted vps like the following : criticize himself , i think john never will i i ) from luge . latrobe . edu . au ( hussein shokouhi ) ronald geluykens has extensively worked on this issue in english . he has published a book in 1992 under the title of ' from grammar to discourse : left-dislocated construction ' . knud lambrescht has also done something on french . he has also published a book on french discourse and syntax in 1994 . surely , you can find a good number of references in those two books .

<subject> linguistics in science fiction </subject> content - length : 3073 the postings on linguistics in science fiction for the past couple of months have been interesting , but curiously limited to comparing two types or genres of writing as if all that is going on with linguistics in science fiction these days is that some writers who are sf novelists have been injecting a few ' neat linguistic ideas ' into their narratives and some ( distinctly other ) group of writers who are linguists read these stories for fun and like to point out the borrowed ideas to other linguists . thats not all that 's happening these days folks . it seems to me that some of the most interesting things going on with linguistics in science fiction is in the blurring of these and other genres ( a general phenomena that george steiner argued was well underway 20 years ago in his _ after babel _ ) . it does n't take much digging through my library to come up with some examples of writers who ' ply the frames ' of sf in ways that deserve to be read by linguists ' for serious ' . samuel r . delany 's novels have been mentioned on the list , but he has also published two volumes of linguistic essays , _ the jewel - hinged jaw : notes on the language of science fiction _ 1977 . new york : dragon press . and _ starboard wine : more notes on the language of science fiction _ 1984 . new york : dragon press . richard rorty , probably known by many linguists interested in the philosophy of language ( from his writing on the ' linguistic turn ' in that field ) , tells a science fiction story about a mid-twenty - first century expedition to antipodea , a planet where the natives lack the concept of mind as part of his argument about ' persons without minds ' in _ philosophy and the mirror of nature _ 1980 . suzette haden elgin is a third writer ( and a linguist ) who writes about science fiction ' for serious ' . one medium in which she does this is the linguistics & science fiction network , which publishes a newsletter ( $ 10 annual membership fee ) out of the ozark center for language studies ( p . o . box 1137 , huntsville , ar 72740 e - mail : ocls @ sibylline . com . ) . i ' m sure that there are other such ' blurred genre ' pieces at the interface between science fiction and linguistic theory . i 'd encourage other subscribers to describe them here in addition to the usual novels and short stories ( the serious stuff can be read ' just for fun ' too . . . ) . paul gracie

<subject> cognitive science technical reports </subject> the following new technical reports are now available from the institute for research in cognitive science : probabilistic matching of brain images j . c . gee l . lebriquer c . barillot d . r . haynor ircs-95 - 07 $ 2 . 20 image matching has emerged as an important area of investigation in medical image analysis . in particular , much attention has been focused on the atlas problem , in which a template representing the structural anatomy of the human brain is deformed to match anatomic brain images from a given individual . the problem is made difficult because there are important differences in both the gross and local morphology of the brain among normal individuals . we have formulated the image matching problem under a bayesian framework . the bayesian methodology facilitates a principled approach to the development of a matching model . of special interest is its capacity to deal with uncertainty in the estimates , a potentially important but generally ignored aspect of the solution . in the construction of a reference system for the human brain , the bayesian approach is well suited to the task of modeling variation in morphology . statistical information about morphological variability , accumulated over past samples , can be formally introduced into the problem formulation to guide the matching or normalization of future data sets . bayesian approach to the brain image matching problem j . c . gee l . lebriquer c . barillot d . r . haynor r . bajcsy ircs-95 - 08 $ 1 . 80 the application of image matching to the problem of localizing structural anatomy in images of the human brain forms the specific aim of our work . the interpretation of such images is a difficult task for human observers because of the many ways in which the identity of a given structure can be obscured . our approach is based on the assumption that a common topology underlies the anatomy of normal individuals . to the degree that this assumption holds , the localization problem can be solved by determining the mapping from the anatomy of a given individual to some referential atlas of cerebral anatomy . previous such approaches have in many cases relied on a physical interpretation of this mapping . in this paper , we examine a more general bayesian formulation of the image matching problem and demonstrate the approach on two-dimensional magnetic resonance images . xtag system - a wide coverage grammar for english christy doran dania egedi beth ann hockey b . srinivas martin zaidel ircs-95 - 09 $ 1 . 03 this paper presents the xtag system , a grammar development tool based on the tree adjoining grammar ( tag ) formalism that includes a wide-coverage syntactic grammar for english . the various components of the system are discussed and preliminary evaluation results from the parsing of various corpora are given . results from the comparison of xtag against the ibm statistical parser and the alvey natural language tool parser are also given . disambiguation of super parts of speech ( or supertags ) : almost parsing aravind k . joshi b . srinivas ircs-95 - 10 $ 1 . 28 in a lexicalized grammar formalism such as lexicalized tree - adjoining grammar ( ltag ) , each lexical item is associated with at least one elementary structure ( supertag ) that localizes syntactic and semantic dependencies . thus a parser for a lexicalized grammar must search a large set of supertags to choose the right ones to combine for the parse of the sentence . we present techniques for disambiguating supertags using local information such as lexical preference and local lexical dependencies . the similarity between ltag and dependency grammars is exploited in the dependency model of supertag disambiguation . the performance results for various models of supertag disambiguation such as unigram , trigram and dependency-based models are presented . a freely available syntactic lexicon for english dania egedi patrick martin ircs-95 - 11 $ 1 . 18 this paper presents a syntactic lexicon for english that was originally derived from the oxford advanced learner 's dictionary and the oxford dictionary of current idiomatic english , and then modified and augmented by hand . there are more than 37 , 000 syntactic entries from all 8 parts of speech . an x - windows based tool is available for maintaining the lexicon and performing searches . c and lisp hooks are also available so that the lexicon can be easily utilized by parsers and other programs . lexicalization and grammar development b . srinivas dania egedi christy doran tilman becker ircs-95 - 12 $ 1 . 18 in this paper we present a fully lexicalized grammar formalism as a particularly attractive framework for the specification of natural language grammars . we discuss in detail feature - based , lexicalized tree adjoining grammars ( fb-ltag s ) , a representative of the class of lexicalized grammars . we illustrate the advantages of lexicalized grammars in various contexts of natural language processing , ranging from wide-coverage grammar development to parsing and machine translation . we also present a method for compact and efficient representation of lexicalized trees . a processing model for free word order languages owen rambow aravind k . joshi ircs-95 - 13 $ 2 . 00 like many verb-final languages , german displays considerable word-order freedom : there is no syntactic constraint on the ordering of the nominal arguments of a verb , as long as the verb remains in final position . this effect is referred to as ` ` scrambling ' ' , and is interpreted in transformational frameworks as leftward movement of the arguments . furthermore , arguments from an embedded clause may move out of their clause ; this effect is referred to as ` ` long-distance scrambling ' ' . while scrambling has recently received considerable attention in the syntactic literature , the status of long-distance scrambling has only rarely been addressed . the reason for this is the problematic status of the data : not only is long-distance scrambling highly dependent on pragmatic context , it also is strongly subject to degradation due to processing constraints . as in the case of center-embedding , it is not immediately clear whether to assume that observed unacceptability of highly complex sentences is due to grammatical restrictions , or whether we should assume that the competence grammar does not place any restrictions on scrambling ( and that , therefore , all such sentences are in fact grammatical ) , and the unacceptability of some ( or most ) of the grammatically possible word orders is due to processing limitations . in this paper , we will argue for the second view by presenting a processing model for german . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * how to access reports : the reports are available in bound form for the price listed above , or may be obtained for free , electronically . to obtain a compressed postscript copy of the report , open an anonymous ftp session on ftp . cis . upenn . edu path : pub / ircs / technical-reports the files are named according to their number . for example , report 95-01 is stored as 95-01 . ps . z , 95-02 is stored as 95-02 . ps . z , etc . if you are using ftp , change the setting to binary and download the file . to get a copy of report 95-01 , you would type : binary get 95-01 . ps . z you can also obtain files through electronic mail . send a mail message to ircsserv @ ftp . cis . upenn . edu . the message should read " send technical-reports filename " . you will receive the compressed postscript file in reply . requests for bound copies should be sent to the address listed below , and include a check for the price of the desired report . checks should be made payable to " trustees of the university of pennsylvania .

<subject> notice to subscribers </subject> moderators ' note : as some of you have noted , we have fallen behind in posting messages this summer . the reason is that we are extremely shorthanded right now . as you know , none of our student editors is paid during the summer , so if they want to go to the lsa institute ( ljuba and anna ) , take a " real " 9 - 5 : 00 job ( ron ) , or even get married ( ann ) , all we can say is : a ) godspeed b ) boy , do we now realize how much work you were doing all year ! we have n't edited without help since the list was 1000 subscribers . now it 's 6500 ; and we find that we simply can't keep up in the time we have to give to linguist . ( unfortunately , our universities expect us to teach , write , run academic programs , and otherwise pretend we ' re professors . editing linguist is strictly extra-curricular . ) all this is said , not in order to complain , but simply to ask for your patience with the inevitable slowdown . at this point , we do n't see anything we can do about it . however , in a few weeks , things should improve . ann ( bride of 2 weeks ! ) is helping out now when she can ; and the others will help out again when they get settled . also , software that will make the editing faster should be in place by the end of summer . but , of course , the real solution would be paid editors in the summer , i . e . , grad students on fellowship and enrolled in summer school . thus , we want to thank - - most heartily - - those of you who have contributed to the linguist development fund that makes possible fellowships for student editors . after told you in april that we were $ 5000 short of the $ 8000 we need to retain ljuba and ann , you responded most generously . we received about 200 contributions ranging from $ 5 to $ 500 and coming from all parts of the globe . we are extremely grateful for contributions of all sizes - - and for the many encouraging notes we received as well . the list of 1995 contributors below includes grad students , professors , departments , universities , and commercial and non-commercial publishers . please take a minute to read through it , as we would like to make sure that supporters are recognized - - particularly organizations and publishers , who contribute more as a service to the discipline than for commercial benefits . unfortunately , we are still short of our goal . if you ' ve been thinking of contributing but have n't gotten around to it yet , we 'd very much appreciate your help . please send your contributions to : linguist editorial support fund c / o english dept . eastern michigan u . ypsilanti , mi 48197 usa and , once again , our most sincere thanks to the individuals and institutions listed below . - helen & anthony - - - - - - - - - - 1995 contributors - - - - - - - - valued supporters : anonymous ( 3 ) barbara abbott maher awad yukiko sasaki alam robert beard elabbas benmamoun robert chandler linda coleman alan cienki donna cromer stanley dubinsky bethany dumas susan fischer frank gladney john grinstead yukio hirose alice horning shin ja hwang frances ingemann margaret jackman james jenkins brian joseph martin jung carolyn kirkpatrick yuriko kite ernest mccarus scott mcginnis deborah mandelbaum jeff marck susan pintzuk terence potter mel resnick burton rosner catherine rudin janine scanarelli makoto shimizu beth simon patrons ( $ 50 or more ) : anonymous australia national university ( for pacific linguistics press ) michael bernstein ( for cascadilla press ) garland bills claude boisson e . wayles browne tucker childs bernard comrie julia falk james harris carolyn herrarte richard hudson roderick jacobs karen jensen ( w / matching funds from microsoft ) james kirchner tadao miyamato katsuhiko momoi daniel radzinski alexis manaster ramer barbara pearson joe salmons & monica macaulay ucla yutaka sato ernest scatton karen stanley karl teeter theo vennemann mainstays ( $ 100 or more ) : anonymous victoria fromkin arnold zwicky university of helsinki ? elsevier science ltd . globalink : the translation co . holland academic graphics indiana university linguistics club publications linguistics dept . , academica sinica john benjamins , inc . kluwer academic publishing lawrence erlbaum macquarie dictionary the mit press ( book dept . ) the mit press ( journals dept . ) the mit working papers in linguistics summer institute of linguistics

<subject> summary and acknowledgments : [ n + v ] verbal compounds </subject> content - length : 5298 summary and acknowledgments on [ n + v ] verbs . in march , we sent a message about [ n + v ] verbal compounds . we were working on this kind of compounds in catalan and we wished to know what happen in other languages . we also asked for references . we received some messages . we briefly sum them up in 1 . in 2 . we list the people which answer us and , although we thank them personaly , we ( re ) thank them . 1 . summary our request said something like this : " we are two resarchers at the universitat de girona ( sp ) and we are working on a kind of catalan verbal compounding . we sumarize tha characteristics of these compounds here below . we are interested in other vo languages with the same ( or similar ) process of verb formation . [ n + v ] v verbal compounding in catalan to be more clear we enumerate the relevant characteristics of our compounds . 1 . first of all , we must say that catalan is a vo language . 2 . our compounding looks like a process of noun incorporation where the incorporated noun within the lexical item is the ineternal argument in the syntactic structure . see ( 1 ) : ( 1 ) a . el cacador trenca la cama de l ' ocell . the hunter breaks the leg of the bird b . el cacador camtrenca l ' ocell . the hunter leg + breaks the bird 3 . nevertheless , the noun-incorporation doestn ' t affect to the capacity of the verb of assigning acusative case , this is , the complex verb remains transitive . 4 . this kind of " noun-incorporation " is only possible when the noun incorporated is a in inalienable possession noun ( ipn ) and the new internal argument of the complex verb is the possessor . see ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) : ( 2 ) a . corferir to heat + hurt b . colltorcer to neck + twist ( 3 ) a . * cadiratrencar to chair + break * ferrotorcer to iron + twist 5 . we hypothesise that the ipn acsts as a kind of modifier in the complex verbal form and it does n't act as a verbal argument " most of the people gave us references , they are listed below . most of the answers coincide with the belief that this kind of verbal compounds are backformations from adjectives ( in - er ) or nominal compounds . then " to baby sit " comes from " baby sitter " for example . another repeated idea is that they are n't productive in languages as english , or romance languages . nevertheless , we still claim that both questions , the productiviy and the backformation , are not so clear in catalan . bertienetto notes that maybe there is a relation between this kind of nominal incorporation and a progressive aspect ( it has been also noted in the literature about the theme ; see , for example miller g . ( 1993 ) : complex verb formation , j . benjamins . ) . j . alvarez sent to us an interesting paper on incorporation and possessor ascension in guajiro . in that language , not only inp are able to be incorported but also other kind of nouns . we have n't demonstrated our hypothesis yet but we are carry on with our research and any comment is always welcome . references alvarez , jose ( 1994 ) : " estudios de linguistica guajira " . gobernacion del estado de zulia , maracaibo , venezuela . gavarro , anna ( 1990 ) : syntactic theory and the grammar of catalan compounds , phdiss , university of edinburg . klingebiel , kathryn ( 1989 ) : noun + verb compounding in western romance . berkeley , university of california press . robinson , peter ( 1988 ) : " universals of word formation processes : noun incorporation in the acquisition of samoan as a second language " velazquez-castillo , maura ( 1993 ) : the grammar of inalienability : possession and noun incorporation in parguayan guarani . phdiss , university of california , san diego . 2 . acknowledgements jose alvarez ( universidad de zulia , jalvar @ conicit . ve ) pier marco bertinetto ( scuola normale superiore dei pisa , bertinet @ sns . it ) george aaron broadwell ( suny - albany , g . broadwell @ albany . edu ) anna gavarro ( universitat autonoma de barcelona , ilfth @ cc . uab . es ) jose ignacio hualde ( university of illinois , jihualde @ ux1 . cso . uiuc . edu ) suzanne kemmer ( university of california , san diego , kemmer @ ruf . rice . edu ) arantza martinez ( univerisitat del pais basc , fvmaeca @ sd . ehu . es ) peter robinson ( university of queensland , peterr @ lingua . cltr . uq . oz . au ) max wheeler ( univerity of sussex , maxw @ cogs . susx . ac . uk ) olga fullana ( fullana @ skywalker . udg . es ) lluisa gracia ( gracia @ skywalker . udg . es ) univerittat de girona dept . filologia i filosofia pl . ferrater mora , 1 e-17071 girona spain

<subject> feminine he </subject> feminine he ouch ! no doubt about it , pronouns and gender are touchy topics . robert millar ( in metaphorically slapping me around a little in the ad hominem mode ) makes some good points but mistakes my focus a bit , misspeaks my findings somewhat , and misstates the fuller design of my position a lot . his linguistic list vol-6 - 835 ( 22 jun 1995 ) responds to my vol-6 - 806 ( 12 jun 1995 ) . i don ' t mean to say that , as robert millar attributes , " 's he ' entered english as a whole suddenly at the advent of printing " - - puhleeeze . i do mean to say that the h - stem feminine suddenly , after printing begins , disappears forever from the written record . my broader conclusion is that the h - stem feminine was alive for centuries beyond the oed 's orthodox-view account of its purported demise . i don ' t discount the sh - forms during the periods when and in the regions where they are amply attested . far be it . i do , however , maintain that the " significant " cause , in the overview , for the disappearance of the h - stem feminine was , not that it began to resemble phonetically the masculine , but rather the standardizing force of printing ( the motive for this is a separate question ) . and , too , there is the telling evidence that spoken pronoun use is often quite different from written . and i am suggesting that some of the oe h - stems survived in speech beyond printing 's seeming signal of their demise . the late survival of the h - stem feminine has the implication for socio / political linguistics that 18th century grammarians , regarded during these past decades as androcentric ( for having written down the " he rule " ) must be admitted to not have been so - - " he " is the principal thrust of the androcentric argument , right ? i am tempted to apologize for my insensitivity to other people 's faculty for correctness . in this case , it resulted in robert millar suffering mood swings - - feelings he shared with us - - his sorrow , his anger , regarding my position . my intention was not to academically abuse or linguistically victimize anybody . but despite his mood swings , we may all nonetheless benefit from his hot flashes of insight appropriate to his rejoinder to my native morphology of singular " they " hypothesis . but i will not continue the " they " discussion here , however , so 's not to detract from the late survival of the h - stem feminine presently under discussion , and indeed much more the hot topic . robert millar says that he suspects that i only have a slight understanding of dialect diversity , and that my discussing material from _ piers plowman _ and _ ayenbite of inwyt _ is a way to " circumvent . . . lalme , mcintosh and samuels . " first i would suggest that he provide fuller citations , this for the benefit of those on the list who concentrate in other areas of linguistics than this subject ; and second i would like to make available to him and anybody else some of my charts resulting from my indexing and sorting all the citations for all the forms for all the third person pronouns in the oed . m . l . samuals , " dialects and grammar , " in _ a companion to piers plowman _ ( ed . , john a . alfred , 1988 ) , specifically identifies by dialect nine of the seventeen manuscripts of the a - version of _ piers plowman _ . these are the ones that had already been identified in kane - donaldson , 1960 ( _ piers plowman , the a - version _ , george kane ) , after generations of effort . the book is a momentous compendium that in my thinking was conceived with the intention of making work such as mine possible . i use the seventeen manuscripts of the a - version of _ piers _ as the mainstay of my argument . samuals is unable to identify the dialects in nearly half the manuscripts of piers . i specifically focus on _ piers _ because it is a manageable corpus that anyone can go and check for themselves . _ piers _ is a great source for studying diverse forms because the forms are all variations on the same text . where can one find such a wealth of data for comparative analysis ? and piers can also be considered the first highly " popular " work in medieval english , and for this reason , the scribes , in copying the work for their intended audiences , would tend to avoid esoteric , literary , and archaic forms . the " cult of auctoritas " is the conservative emulation of older forms by the copying scribe . robert millar alludes to this to explain the h - stem feminines found in manuscripts of _ piers _ . i have met with this criticism before . i will make available to anyone who wants them particular lines as found in all seventeen manuscripts , and rather than the conservation of forms , the contrary of the auctoritas principle seems to be found in _ piers _ , whereby the scribes , in copying from the original , tended to modify it to regional conventions . i am not saying that auctoritas was not in many instances of medieval scribal practice the rule . i ' m saying that looking at lines of _ piers _ , through the seventeen manuscripts , sees in them a tremendous diversity . and even so , the use of the h - stems in all the manuscripts - - assuming for the sake of argument they were not in colloquial use - - indicates that they were well known , nonetheless , does n't it ? robert millar reads between my lines that i consider the anglo - normans as " wicked . " not so . chronocentrism in the reading of history is as inimical to reason and human understanding as is ethnocentrism in the reading of culture . he holds to the orthodox view and says that " the rising london standard spread much more rapidly than it ever would have done in an age of purely manuscript culture . " but would n't the london " standard " better be called the status dialect . it is mistaken to assume that writing , before and after printing , reflected how people generally used language day-to - day . most people talk like _ i love lucy _ and _ the honeymooners _ , not like _ the new york times _ . today , for example , the indefinite / proverbial " he " is primarily a written status form ; the singular " they " a spoken form . i think it is very safe to assume that then , just as now , there is a common english and a status english within a particular regional dialect . it is on the basis of this assumption , coupled with evidence for the widespread knowledge of the h - stem feminine in the generations before printing , that i am postulating the late survival of the h - stem feminine . anybody who would like to have my charts showing the " persistence " of all the feminine and masculine h - stem forms from the 11th century on , comparative exhibits of lines through the seventeen manuscripts of _ piers _ , pronoun paradigms from the same manuscripts , and perhaps a few other items - - they are available for a dollar copy charge and two stamps for usa . jeffrey weber , 2843 n . spaulding ave . , chicago , illinois , 60618 , usa . this current transmission is more an aside than the summary that will be forthcoming . i have received an excellent critique from wittysan ( sean ) , which he sent also to robert millar , and would be happy for the asking to share it and my response as this inquiry continues .
<subject> bangani </subject> i am looking for any information and / or bibliographical references on an indian language called bangani . this language apparently has preserved some remarkable archaisms , and would appear from the available data in fact not to be an indo - aryan language . the only information i know of on the language appears in two articles by claus peter zoller in mss 49 and 50 , 1988 and 1989 . daniel baum the hebrew university of jerusalem jerusalem israel dmbaum @ shani . net

<subject> date formats </subject> hello , this is a query about the different ways in which dates can be expressed in different languages , and whether there are constraints that apply in relation to register ( eg formal , informal , etc ) , genre ( magazine , newspaper , personal vs business letter , etc ) , historical , instrumental ( format of calendars ) , nationality , etc . my initial impressions are the following . as far the english speaking world goes , in britain there is a variety of ways in which dates can be expressed in writing , including day month year ; day-ordinal month year ; month day , year ; month day-ordinal , year . interestingly , this variety is not found in numerical form , in which ` day / month / year ' is expected . note that the separators vary , the most common being the slash ( / ) , others being the dash ( - ) , the period ( . ) and the blank space ( ) . in the other formats in which words are used , only the ` month ' slot can be spelled out , with days and years being expressed in numbers . variations include the use of ` the ' preceding ordinal day numbers . sometimes one can find different formats being used in different parts of the same publication , eg the header and the report in a newspaper . this seems to be in contrast with the usa where ` month day , year ' seems to predominate whatever the situation , even when expressed numerically as in 1 / 7 / 95 which is normally read by americans as the seventh day of the month of january , whereas the british would take it to mean the first day of the month of july , which is a 6 - month difference . apparently , the americans are the only ones to adopt month / day / year . someone once told me this is an old format which came into being as a result of the fact that , in looking for today 's date , one would look in a calendar first of all for the current month , with the year being taken for granted . any ideas ? what 's the norm in other languages / dialects , etc ? thanks in advance , tony - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - tony berber sardinha | tony1 @ liverpool . ac . uk aelsu | fax 44-51 - 794-2739 university of liverpool | po box 147 | http : / / www . liv . ac . uk / liverpool l69 3bx | ~ tony1 / homepage . html uk | - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<subject> summary : negated questions and exclamations </subject> about two weeks ago , i posted a query on two subjects : i was looking for languages ( 1 ) which can or , on the contrary , cannot use negated interrogatives like " look , over there - is n't that john ? " in order to express a positive expectation , and ( 2 ) which have negated wh-exclamations like german : " was du nicht alles weisst ! " ( lit . : ' what you do n't know all ! ' ) or serbocroatian " sta nije sve doziveo ! " ( lit . : ' what he did n't all live through ! ' ) , that refer to the positive , not the negative fact . first of all , i wish to thank the following colleagues for their contributions : suzanne albrecht ( sanabria @ zedat . fu-berlin . de ) gisle andersen ( henga @ alf . uib . no ) birgitta englund dimitrova ( birgitta . englund @ tolk . su . se ) frederik fouvry ( fouvry @ llsun4 . essex . ac . uk ) keith goeringer ( keg @ violet . berkeley . edu ) michael israel ( israel @ ling . ucsd . edu ) dalina kallulli ( dalina . kallulli @ avh . unit . no ) jussi karlgren ( jussi @ sics . se ) e . h . klein - v . d . laaken ( klein @ let . rug . nl ) james kirchner ( jpkirchner @ aol . com ) randy lapolla ( hslapolla @ ccvax . sinica . edu . tw ) pierre larrivee ( aaa552 @ agora . ulaval . ca ) bert peeters ( bert . peeters @ modlang . utas . edu . au ) francisco raga ( raga @ vents . uji . es ) alexandr rosen ( alexandr . rosen @ ff . cuni . cz ) cristina sanz ( sanzc @ gusun . acc . georgetown . edu ) karen stanley ( karen _ stanley @ cpcc . cc . nc . us ) jan vorster ( vorsterj @ mtb . und . ac . za ) ton van der wouden ( vdwouden @ let . rug . nl ) deborah yeager ( kyeager @ prism . nmt . edu ) ning zhang ( zning @ epas . utoronto . ca ) the languages i received information about were : afrikaans , albanian , catalan , chinese , czech , english , dutch , norwegean , spanish , swedish , yucatec maya . no additional languages have been named where the use of negated questions like " look , over there - is n't that john ? " was not possible ; so apache and navajo are still the only examples i have found so far . . as to the negated wh-exclamations , what is most interesting is that they do exist in languages where the native speakers i had asked so far had been convinced that they do not . examples for this are english and spanish , cf . : what i did n't do to get that report finished on time ! ( karen stanley ) cuanto no tendre que sufrir hasta conseguirlo ! ( cristina sanz ) this type of construction can obviously be found in much more languages than i had assumed . in some of them , it seems to be old fashened and not very wide spread , but it still exists as such . ( if anybody now comes to think of one more language that allows that type of utterance - i am still collecting , and i ' m grateful for any help i can get ! ) as to the question of why and how these negated questions and wh-exclamations work : i am dealing with it in paper of mine ( to be published ) , and i ' ll be glad to mail it to anybody who is interested , but i ' m afraid it 's in german . thanks once again to all who helped , and please feel free to contact me if you have any questions . elke hentschel

<subject> pragmatic checking and anaphor resolution </subject> in an article by marslen - wilson , levy , and tyler ( 1982 ) " producing interpretable discourse : the establishment and maintenance of reference " they discuss the role of inference or " pragmatic checking " in the process of anaphor resolution . briefly , anaphoric resolution results from checking the information predicated of the anaphor with the local or preceding discourse and thereby inferring the intended referent . could anyone steer me in the direction of other research which pursues a similar line of argument ? thank you very much . - richard cameron
<subject> typos in fromkin and rodman textbook </subject> this is a query to find out if anyone has a list of the typos that are in an early printing of the fifth edition to the fromkin and rodman textbook " an introduction to language " . i am using the text in an introductory class . while my copy of the book is fine , many of the students bought used versions that have a number of typos in the data sets . so , i was hoping that someone had a list of those typos ( or knew where i could get one ) , so that i can tell the students who have those defective copies . please send any answers to the following address : robinq @ ccwf . cc . utexas . edu thanks robin queen

<subject> nonreferential np 's in english </subject> in a number of lgs ( roviana and yup ' ik eskimo being the two in which i have encountered this ) , nonreferential np 's are phonologically and / or morphologically / syntactically incorporated into the vrb / verb phrase / verb group . are there any similar structural clues which could be used to identify nonreferential np 's in english ? my interest is in identifying nonreferential np 's in written english so that a computer natural lg processing system would know not to set up referents for them to serve as antecedents for subsequent anaphora resolution . compounds ( e . g . duck-shooting season ) can i suppose be treated superficially as single words , but what about things like ' lose faith in ' , ' catch sight of ' . of course , some criteria will involve larger discourse issues , but it may be that it is possible to identify at least some nonreferential np 's " cheaply " , i . e . just by looking within a clause and / or considering inherent lexical semantics . i will summarize and post any replies to this list . regards , simon corston .

<subject> sum : representing retroflex </subject> summary : representing retroflex at the beginning of the month i posted a query that asked for information on an alternative way of representing retroflexed segments as dorsalized coronals instead of [ - anterior ] . warm thanks to those who responded : philip hamilton phamilto @ epas . utoronto . ca richard desrochers desrochr @ ere . umontreal . ca wechsler wechsler @ world . std . com suzanne urbanczyk suzanne @ oitunix . oit . umass . edu mark verhijde mark . verhyde @ let . ruu . nl stig eliasson stig . eliasson @ ling . uu . se here is a list of annotated references followed by contributors ' excerpts on the following topics : 1 . against dorsalization 2 . origins of coronal domination of retroflex : sanskrit evidence 3 . phonetic features of retroflex blevins 1994 . course notes from the 1994 australian linguistic institute . cho , y . 1990 . parameters of consonantal assimilation . phd thesis stanford about sanskrit retroflexed elements . the claim made here is that retroflexation equals the formation of segments that contain two place nodes , cor and dor , i . e . what some have defined as a " complex " place . interestingly , in assuming retroflexed segments as having two place nodes , some neutralization effects at right word edges fall out quite naturally .

<subject> summary : borrowing of body part terms </subject> many moons ago i posted a query regarding the borrowing of certain body part terms , notably , heart , eye , ear , and tongue , and never posted a summary ( tsk , tsk ) . here it is : first of all , i have been able to find , either through linguist or from other sources , clear examples of almost all the basic body part terms , including ' hand ' ( many iranian languages from persian , ossetic from chechen - ingush ) , ' heart ' ( polish from czech , many indo - aryan and iranian languages from persian , turkish from arabic ) , ' tongue ' ( a whole bunch of ethiopian languages ) , and so on . the one for which i have no completely clearly documented example is ' ear ' ( although there are cases of ' ear ' being replaced by a neologism from within the language itself ) . * * i am thus still looking for an example of borrowing involving the word for ' ear ' . * * a discussion of the whole question of borrowability of body part terms and its relation to language classification ( esp . with reference to the altaic question ) will appear in a paper by alexander vovin and me to appear next year in the zeitschrift der deutschen morgelandischen gesellschaft . finally , i would like to summarize the information provided by those who responded to my original query on linguist , to all of whom my deepest thanks : shirley silver ( silver @ sonoma . edu ) reported that mary haas , having reconstructed proto - hokan ' ear ' ( and ' navel ' ) noted that one could find or reconstruct similar forms in other language families ( penutian , yuki , and the algic languages wiyot & yurok ) , which would seem to suggest borrowing . this is the closest i have come so far to a borrowed ' ear ' . benjamin moore ( ben @ edr5r . edr . co . jp ) reports that in modern japanese , the term for animal tongue used as food is ' tan ' a borrowing of english ' tongue . ' david costa ( dcosta @ garnet . berkeley . edu ) and george aaron broadwell ( g . broadwell @ albany . edu ) note that choctaw _ nishkin _ ' eye ' ( and according to costa other forms in western muskogean ( chickasaw & choctaw , + mobilian jargon ) , are from some algonquian source ( note proto - algonquian * _ ne $ ki : n $ ekwi _ ) , a suggestion which i have found goes back at least to mary haas . however , i should add that ives goddard , whom i asked about this , expressed strong doubt about any such connection . bruce connell ( connellb @ vax . ox . ac . uk ) reported that ' heart ' in usaghade ( lower cross < benue - congo ) is apparently borrowed from a neighbouring bantu language , with semantic shift . tone marking omitted , usaghade ebuma , ' heart ' proto - bantu * - bumo , 's tomach ' . jakob dempsey ( jakob @ u . washington . edu ) reported that the common word for ' tongue ' in standard chinese and in hmong - mien languages ( generally speaking ) [ hm = miao - yao ] is very likely related , suggesting borrowing , since these languages are not considered genetically linked . norbert strade < lingnost @ hum . aau . dk > reported that the finnish word for " neck " , " kaula " , is borrowed from baltic . cynthia vakareliyska ( vakarel @ oregon . uoregon . edu ) pointed that some slavists believe that the russian word for ' eye ' ( _ glaz _ ) is borrowed from germany . ( i have been slowly tracing the origin of this opinion , which appears to be in error , but have not yet gotten all the way to the bottom of it . in my view the correct etymology , which is given by several authorities , is a shift in meaning of the native word for 's tone ' , ' boulder ' or the like ) . references from the above : connell , b .

<subject> reduplication in child language acquisition and foreigner talk , etc . </subject> in conducting a study of derivational morphology in creole languages , i have been investigating the origins of reduplication in the same . specifically , i am trying to determine whether it is best to explain the form and / or meaning of reduplicated structures in creoles in terms of the influence of substrate languages or in terms of the effect of language universals , or both . it has been suggested that data from child language acquisition studies may shed light on the question . also , data regarding " baby talk " and " foreigner talk " ( i . e talk by adults to children and non-native speakers , respectively ) may help in determining the extent to which reduplication in creoles should be explained in terms of language universals . additionally , the patterns of use of reduplication by adult second language learners in theirnon-native language ( s ) may also prove useful . thus , i would greatly appreciate any information you can give me ( by way of data , descriptions , references , etc . ) regarding the following questions : 1 . is reduplication a universal feature of children 's speech , baby talk , or foreigner talk cross-linguistically ? any examples ? 2 . where reduplication is indeed a feature of the above-mentioned speech varieties , what semantics are associated with the reduplicated forms ? specifically , is reduplication used as a category-changing operation , or is it used only in a modificatory way ( e . g . diminutivization , augmentation , etc . ) with no category change effected on the words to which it applies ? 3 . where reduplication is a feature of the above-mentioned speech varieties , what phonological form does it take ? i . e is total reduplication the rule ( e . g . " the tiny tiny mouse ' ) ? or is total reduplication with modification ( e . g . " teeny-weeny " ) what we find ? or do we find partial reduplication of one kind or another , in which only syllables or parts of syllables are reduplicated ? andy saperstein adsap @ ling . ohio-state . edu ohio state university

<subject> q : chomsky 's sea voyage ; how many of each kind of linguist are there </subject> ( 1 ) somewhere there is a story of chomsky , seasick and uncertain of his future , coming with the idea of transformational grammar while traveling aboard ship . i am wondering if anybody remembers where . ( 2 ) are there are any surveys or other statistics that show how many linguists work within the different schools and also within different areas ( e . g . , phonology vs . syntax , comparative vs . theoretical , etc . ) . i will post summaries .
<subject> summary : chomsky on letting the theory choose </subject> i recently asked where it was that chomsky said that in unclear cases we should let the theory choose the right analysis . the answer , supplied by jan odijk , barbara abbott , and michael israel ( to all of whom my thanks ) turns out to be syntactic structures , p . 14 : . . . in order to set the aims of grammar significantly it is sufficient to assume a partial knowledge of sentences and non-sentences . that is , we may assume for this discussion that certain sequences of phonemes are definitely sentences , and that certain others sequences are definitely non-sentences . in many intermediate cases we shall be prepared to let the grammar itself decide , when the grammar is set up in the simplest way so that it includes the clear sentences and excludes the clear non-sentences . . . . a certain number of clear cases , then will provide us with a criterion of adequacy for any particular grammar .
<subject> review of arboreal for windows </subject> review of : arboreal for windows , cascadilla press . by dr . matthew crocker ( mwc @ cogsci . ed . ac . uk ) centre for cognitive science , university of edinburgh . arboreal for windows ( henceforth , arborwin ) is a package designed to facilitate drawing trees within microsoft ( tm ) windows ( tm ) applications . arborwin consists simply of a truetype ( tm ) font in which keys are mapped to tree component shaped characters rather than standard keyboard symbols . the advantage of drawing trees in this way is that arborwin is very portable , and can be used in any wysiwyg windows ( tm ) application which allows you to select specific fonts ( i . e . most ) . the disadvantage , broadly , is that ` type-setting ' or layout of the trees is left to the user . the ` characters ' of arborwin include left , right , vertical , and ` triangle ' branches - - each of several widths ( but all the same height ) . the font is also fully scalable . in general , i found that arborwin behaved as intended , given that it is simply a font-based package . its most basic limitation is that there is a relatively small selection of branch sizes ( i . e . how narrow or wide a branch is ) . in practice , the most common problem i encountered was that ` triangle ' branches ( eg , for phrase without internal structure ) could n't be made wide enough . . . given that one often wants to put fairly long phrases under these . the only way to increase the width was to increase the point size for the branch ; but this also increases the height of the particular branch , and makes trees look disproportionate and inconsistent . being font-based , however , also means it cannot attain the flexibility of alternative packages ( eg , the ` tree ' package for latex ) . the ' tree ' package , for example , takes as input a declarative tree specification ( as a bracketed list ) and then automatically typesets the tree , and also permits crossing branches , and upside-down trees . since typesetting is automatic , the tree formatting is consistent , and tailored to the size / length of terminals ( including the triangle branches ) . overall the package is simple to use and quite effective if your requirements ( in terms of both sophistication , and layout quality ) are not too demanding . if greater flexibility , consistency , and quality is required , then i believe there is still no substitute for latex and its associated packages . dr . matthew crocker , esrc research fellow centre for cognitive science university of edinburgh mwc @ cogsci . ed . ac . uk

<subject> proper names </subject> dear linguists , i am looking for information and references regarding proper names ( especially people 's names ) . proper names are difficult to handle for nlp applications , for various reasons ; but one thing is sure : if you wish to analyse large corpora of texts , you will bump into a large number of proper names , and many of of these will be foreign proper names . so i am trying to gather any possible piece of knowledge ( references and pointers are welcome ) for as many languages as i can regarding the following points , in order to enhance a syntactic analyser for french : - the standard fashion to name people ( in french , usually a first name and a last name , but some language may add to this simple pattern additonal pieces . - what kind of unusual character may be found in proper names : for example , in france you may find names from brittany like rowarc ' h or floc ' h , where the quote is likely to cause segmentation errors ; the same holds for some dutch names such as op ' t hof , etc . - what are the official rules for spelling proper names , especially names that are composed of prepositional phrases , like " de gaulle " , or " van voorst tot voorst " : in other words , which parts are capitalized , and which are not . - what are the most frequent morphemes used in proper names , or in other words if there is ( used to be ) a preferred way for creating new proper names from a restricted list of morphemes . - what are the compounding rules for proper names . if there is enough interest , i ' ll post a summary . many thanks in advance , francois .

if you are afraid you are going to miss it , you should be in touch with the society * before * that happens . there is no deadline for registration at the conference , but we would like to know beforehand if you plan to attend . iii . submission of material . anyone wishing to present data at the society 's conference must submit it for publication in the _ yuen ren treasury of chinese dialect data _ . all submissions will be subject to review . if you cannot be present at the conference , you may still submit material to the current issue of the _ treasury _ . this conference is independent of the american oriental society meeting . there is no fee for the yuen ren society meeting , but it is the responsibility of everyone who attends to pay any aos registration fees that may be required of them . iv . attendance by non-participants . the conference is open to everyone , including people who are not members of the yuen ren society . there will be no fee for attending the conference , but there may be a small on-site registration fee for anyone who wants a copy of the _ yuen ren treasury _ . the _ treasury _ will serve as the combined handout for the whole conference . v . notes on style and format . 1 . the society favors the use of gwoyeu romatzyh , but will not reject any other reasonable system of romanization , as long as all tonal distinctions are represented in some consistent way . papers that use romanization without some form of tonal distinction will be rejected . both traditional and simplified characters are welcome . 2 . the languages of the conference and of all papers should be english or mandarin . 3 . length of individual presentations at the conference will be variable , with up to 25 minutes per presentation , and discussion ad hoc . please tell the society how long your presentation will be . length of documents in the _ treasury _ will also be variable , depending on their contents . 4 . all papers should include a section in the bibliography entitled " sources of dialect data " or something comparable , in addition to the ordinary list of works cited . papers introducing data from original fieldwork * must * list the names of all sites represented , together with information about the informants used and the dates of fieldwork . papers using any data not gathered by the author personally * must * list the sources of each distinct set of data . it is a good idea to distinguish different sources , even if they represent the same site . 5 . all submissions to the _ yuen ren treasury _ must be made in camera-ready hard copy . handwritten documents , unless they are remarkably neat , will ordinarily be rejected . for documents produced on a computer , common serif fonts such as courier or new york should be used for roman letter writing apart from ipa , and a sharply legible bitmap or outline font such as sung should be used for kanji . very neatly handwritten kanji are acceptable . if in doubt , send a sample of your typefaces to the society * before * the submission deadline . 6 . finished documents should have margins a minimum of one inch wide . print should be black only , and the body of the text should be between 12 and 14 point in size and double spaced . documents produced on a computer should be printed at not less than 300 dpi . 7 . in general , papers should follow the style guidelines of a recent edition of the _ chicago manual of style _ . vi . restrictions : barring exceptional circumstances , the following will be considered outside the scope of the conference , since there are already other outlets for them : 1 . papers emphasizing formal analysis or formal representation . 2 . new romanization schemes . 3 . papers comparing a single modern dialect to the jin ' in ( a . k . a . _ chiehyunn _ ) phonological system . 4 . papers all of whose data is culled from published sources , unless the source is rare or for some reason poorly known . 5 . studies of " mandarin " , " taiwanese " , " cantonese " , " hakka " , or other standard dialects , based neither on fieldwork nor the speech of named sites or sources . 6 . presentations that do not consist primarily of data .

<subject> sum : nonreferential np 's in english </subject> a week or two ago , i sent the following query to the folks on linguist : > my interest is in identifying nonreferential np 's in written english so > that a computer natural lg processing system would know not to set up > referents for them to serve as antecedents for subsequent anaphora > resolution . compounds ( e . g . duck-shooting season ) can i suppose be > treated superficially as single words , but what about things like ' lose > faith in ' , ' catch sight of ' . of course , some criteria will involve > larger discourse issues , but it may be that it is possible to identify > at least some nonreferential np 's " cheaply " , i . e . just by looking > within a clause and / or considering inherent lexical semantics . my interest is also in examples like ' john is a teacher ' , where ' a teacher ' is not used to introduce a new discourse referent , but rather to characterize one which has already been introduced . my thanks to gregory ward , marion kee , and louise mcnally for their replies and comments . to summarize my investigations to date and the comments of these people : ward , gregory , richard sproat , and gail mckoon . 1991 ` ` a pragmatic analysis of so - called anaphoric islands , ' ' in language 67 : 439-474 . - - contrary to what i was assuming about compounds , subparts may serve as antecedents for pronominal anaphora . louise mcnally noted : ' first of all , it appears that languages with article systems ( like english and other germanic lgs . , and the romance lgs . ) mark " nonreferentiality " by the absence of an article ( i . e . via bare singular or , more commonly , bare plural nps ) . although such nps may function syntactically just like nps with articles ( in contrast to incorporated nominals ) , semantically and pragmatically they are quite distinct . . . in english things are complicated by the fact that bare plurals also appear to denote natural kinds , but this appears to be the [ exception rather ] than the rule ( bare nominals in the other languages i ' ve looked at do not have this interpretation ) . thus , what is shared by incorporated and non-incorporated , nonreferential nps is thus ( 1 ) the absence of an article ; and ( 2 ) their semantics / pragmatics . - - i would treat bare nominals as property denoting ( alternatively , as contributing only descriptive content ) , whereas i treat nps with articles as entity denoting ( alternatively , as contributing both descriptive content and , crucially , a discourse referent ) . quantificational nps are another matter altogether . there appear to be differences between the discourse anaphoric properties of nouns in compounds ( like " baby-sitter " ) and bare plurals that occur as independent elements in sentences . specifically , bare nominals are much more likely to felicitously license discourse anaphora to " token " entities ( as opposed to kinds ) than are nouns inside compounds . i have not investigated this in detail , but i suspect that the differences involve the sorts of existential inferences you get via the use of the compounds vs . full sentences ( for example , i can truthfully describe someone as a " tomato grower " at time _ t _ without there being any tomatoes that the person is growing at _ t _ ; in contrast , if it is true that fred grew tomatoes at _ t _ , there must have been tomatoes at _ t _ that he grew . - - this pair does n't do justice to the complexity of the problem , but i hope it gives you an idea of the differences one finds between the conditions on the applicability of nouns as descriptions and the truth of sentences . ) ' marion kee suggested marking phrasal verbs in the lexicon , for example ' catch sight of ' , where 's ight ' is non-referential . while this is an eminently practical solution to a thorny problem , my mandate is to explore methods for automatically identifying such non-referential uses , this being ( presumably ) more general , and computationally less expensive than searching the lexicon for given collocations . i am still musing on structural cues which might be used , perhaps in combination with semantic information . finally , i have attached a brief summary of the ' backgrounded object construction ' in roviana , a w . oceanic lg , spoken in the solomon islands . i am currently working on a sketch gr for an upcoming volume on oceanic lgs . the construction i am referring to would be called an antipassive by some ( roviana has morpho-syntactic ergativity with really unusual splits ) , ' i cooked the taro ' comes out as a transitive , with ' i ' having ergative ' marking ' ( actually , zero for ergative , which is one of the unusual things ) , and there is transitive morphology on the verb . constituent order vao ' i cooked taro ' / ' i did taro-cooking ' comes out as intransitive , with ' i ' marked as absolutive , and constituent order voa . no transitive morphology on the verb , and you could say that the o has ' moved into the verb phrase ' if you were inclined to use such dynamic metaphors , and could make a case for what a verb phrase was in roviana . i call this the ' backgrounded object construction ' . it is used in subordinate clauses , which do not have morpho-syntactic ergativity , and it does n't involve the marking of a as oblique , so i am not prepared to call it an antipassive . now : you use the backgrounded object construction ( i ) ( optionally ) for pragmatically backgrounding the undergoer in discourse ( coz it is not important ) or ( ii ) ( obligatorily ) if the undergoer is non-specific . by non-specific i mean that the speaker does n't have a particular ref in mind , even if one might be said to exist , e . g . ' i did taro-cooking ' implies taro exists , but you are not focusing on any particular taro . exception : if you are asserting the non-existence of an undergoer by using a prenominal modifier ' none / nothing ' , you can use the normal transitive construction . e . g . ' i did n't kill anyone ' ( there does not exist a person such that i killed them ) = transitive ' i did n't kill anyone ' ( denying the action , not asserting the non-existence of the referent ) = backgrounded object construction . thus : the transitive construction is used if the undergoer is ( a ) asserted to not exist or ( b ) specific and not pragmatically backgrounded . the backgrounded obj construction is used if the undergoer is ( b ) non-specific and not being asserted to not exist or ( b ) specific and pragmatically backgrounded . roviana has articles that mark information statuses like definite . the np in a backgrounded obj construction however can only be a bare noun . my thanks again to those who replied . any further thoughts / comments much appreciated . simon corston
<subject> re : 6 . 923 , sum : chomsky on letting the theory choose </subject> chomsky 's optimism about " letting the theory decide " about unclear cases of grammaticality sharply contrasts with the view proposed by baudrillard ( in _ l ' autre par lui meme _ ) as to the role of theory in forcing reality and in defining us as theory practitioners . i ' m traslating from the spanish version : " the status of theory could only be one of challenging reality . or , rather , the relationship between the two is one of a mutual challenge . for , undoubtedly , also the real is nothing but a challenge to theory - - not an objective state of affairs , but a radical frontier for analysis , beyond which nothing obeys theory or beyond which theory no longer has anything to say . but also theory is only made to disobey reality , and it constitutes its unreachable frontier . irreconciliation between theory and the real : a corollary of the irreconciliation between subjects and their own goals . all attempts at reconciliation are deceiving and are doomed to failure .

<subject> gene flow and indo - europeans </subject> h . m . hubey has made readers of this list aware of an interesting article which appeared in the june 24 , 1995 , issue of science news concerning evidence from dna data indicating a gene flow from anatolia into europe beginning around 9 , 000 years bp . hubey also points out that there is genetic evidence that nomads from the central eurasian yamna culture spread westward into europe approximately 5 , 500 years ago . while it is indeed reasonable to link the first migration with the spread of agriculture , it does not follow that those who migrated spoke any form of indo - european ( " pre - " , " proto - " , or dialects thereof ) . nor does it follow that " [ i ] t is possible that both expansions were responsible for the spread of different subfamilies of indo - european languages . . . " we know from cuneiform records that by 3 , 000 bce anatolia was populated ( at least in part , if not in full ) by people speaking caucasian languages . in eastern anatolia , hurrian and the later attested and closely-related urartean were spoken . these languages have been convincingly shown by sergej starostin and igor diakonoff to be related to northeast caucasian . in central anatolia , hattic was spoken - - this was later replaced by hittite , an indo - european language . diakonoff maintains that hattic was also a caucasian language . finally , diakonoff has claimed that the language spoken by the gutians ( qutians ) was a caucasian language . moreover , there are no unambiguous references to indo - european people or languages in written records from the ancient near east until just before 2 , 000 bce , and the first references are to hittites . it is generally agreed by specialists ( for example , gamkrelidze , mellaart , puhvel , steiner , among others ) that the hittites were invaders who imposed themselves upon populations speaking caucasian languages ( in particular , hattic ) . thus , there is much stronger evidence that prior to about 2 , 000 bce , anatolia was populated by speakers of caucasian languages than by speakers of indo - european languages . thus , it follows logically that if one were to attempt to correlate gene flow at about 9 , 000 bp from anatolia to europe with language spread that one would tend to think more about very early forms of caucasian rather than indo - european . allan r . bomhard boston , massachusetts

<subject> english only ? </subject> english only ? this is a reaction to the message by jack aubert . i can understand what you mean but i am not so sure whether you compare things with each other that actually should / can be compared . > however , this is not what " bi-lingualism " > really means in the u . s . it means making it easier for non - english speakers > to get through life without having to learn to speak english in the u . s . , the ( mistaken ) idea that english is the national language makes its easier for the people to take it for granted that one can very well get through life without having to learn any other language . since language learning also entails getting to know a different culture , most people miss the opportunity to learn about other ways of living , eating , etc . > national plural mono-lingualism is a curse ! for everything you say about this , you did not mention one single argument that it should be english that can be the national language and not spanish . what would you say about this if the number of citizens speaking spanish fluently outnumbers the amount of people who speak english fluently ? after all , the u . s . just tops off a continent where the great majority speaks spanish . why should they speak english at all , in that country to the north of latin - america ? > history has not saddled us with this curse , as it has done to > belgium , . . . most " ethnic " conflicts ( there are > counter-examples like the hutus and tutsis and the two flavors of irish ) > trace back to language . basque and catalan separatism is based on language . > canada may end up breaking into two states , each with its own disgruntled > linguistic minority . basque and catalan separatism is not based on language . why do we never hear anything about galician separatism on the iberian peninsula ? galician is a language very different from spanish ( and not so different from portuguese ) . the name of the region is galicia and is part of spain . galician is a language much older than spanish itself : it was used for poetry and by the kings in ancient times . still , we do not hear a lot about galician separatism . neither do we hear anything about leonese separatism , aragonese separatism , andalusian separatism , simply because it does not exist . separatism on the peninsula has nothing to do with language . it has everything to do with historic rights of old kingdoms . the comparison with belgium might not be such a good one . the northern part of belgium used to be dutch , this is the reason these people speak dutch . in the u . s . , there is no regional division of groups of native-speakers as there is in belgium ( and like there is in catalunya and euzkadi too ) . it is much more probable that separatism between dutch - speaking belgians and french - speaking belgians be encouraged , because it is easy to say : o . k . , since the flemish live in the north and the walloons in the south , why do n't we split up the country ( and if they would , what can i hold against it ? ) . in the u . s . , this is not a very likely situation since the spanish - speaking citizens live all over the country . there is also a big historical difference : a mexican family living in chicago will never be able to say " jee , we and all our neighbours and all the people in chicago , illinois , michigan , indiana , etc . , we used to belong to another country , a country where spanishwas the language . this soil where we were born and which we owe with thousands of " compatriots " used to belong to a spanish - speaking country . " and what if canada breaks up ? as long as they do it in peace . . . . . really , i think you use the wrong arguments here . i mean , do i use arguments like : look what china has done to tibet : by invading the country they have destroyed a very important cultural and religious heritage , the tibetans are forced to learn chinese , the tibetan culture will be lost soon . so please allow spanish in the u . s . ? no , i do n't use this argument either because you cannot compare a cat with a bird . > allowing ( for example ) native spanish speakers living in the > u . s . to avoid learning english as young as possible and as well as possible > . . . . . . . . . . . . . . etc . allowing millions and millions of people in a modern , industrialized country like the u . s . to avoid learning any other language but their own greatly surprises me . really , from a practical point of view , and trying to agree with jack aubert , i would like to conclude with this . yes , of course plural mono-linguism is a problem . but does it make sense to expect that the half of the population of a country that has worse access to good education is going to make the step of learning two languages well ? as has been investigated in minority regions in europe , it has been proved that people can only learn a language well when they know their own language well . this is the reason the frisian language got reintroduced in the schools in frisia again in the seventies . frisia is a region in the north of holland where people speak frisian and dutch . most schools in the cities have dutch as a main language and frisian as a second language but in the country-side , at least the first three years , mathematics and everything is being taught in frisian and dutch is a second language . there is no separatism in frisia . in fact , the frisians are among the dutch to speak dutch best since a lot of other dutch only speak their local dialect and are ununderstandable for someone who comes from another region . since ( children of ) spanish speakers in the u . s . cannot go to a spanish school to learn their mother tongue thoroughly , they will never be able to learn english really well . it seems more realistic to expect that the ones who already speak their mother-tongue well and who have , generally speaking , better access to better education would learn spanish . let them become bilingual ( and maybe monolingual spanish in the end ? ? ) * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * jelly julia de jong * + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + atw , o . k . i . h . jatstraat 26 * + dept . of general linguistics + 9712 ek groningen * + university of groningen + the netherlands * + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - | e - mail : julia @ let . rug . nl | | http : / / www . let . rug . nl / linguistics / jellydejong . html |
<subject> re : 6 . 933 , misc : english only , a footnote on banning of german </subject> jack aubert writes : > in contrast with most of the topics discussed here , [ national language > policy ] is an > issue where the views of academic linguists have no greater value than the > views of laymen or practicing linguists i beg to differ . lay ( wo ) men 's misconceptions about language are poisoning the public debate about english only , and recognizing the greater value of the views of academic linguists might be just what is needed to improve that debate . is it merely an accident that the vast majority of academic linguists opposes ( while a majority of laypeople supports ) english only and related movements , or is it an indication that those academic linguists know something that the laypeople do not know ? > [ bilingualism in the us ] means making it easier for non - english speakers > to get through life without having to learn to speak english on the grounds > that this is more humane and fairer . i am not an expert on bilingualism , but i have a hunch that this is a very lopsided characterization of bilingualism as currently practiced in ( small pockets of ) the us . i would be good to hear from subscribers who actually are experts on bilingualism . > most " ethnic " conflicts . . . > trace back to language . basque and catalan separatism is based on language . language played absolutely no role in the biggest " ethnic conflict " of our time , i . e . the racist war of the germans against jews , slavs , gypsies and other " non-aryans " . where language does play a role in " ethnic conflicts " , it does so only as ( an important ) part of a different cultural itentity , whatever that is . most of the time , these conflicts are n't purely " ethnic " but also ( and sometimes please do n't freeze onexclusively ) based on other factors such as class . the " ethnic conflict " between hutus and tutsis is an excellent example for this , but the details would lead to far astray . > english - - by accident of history - - is the glue that keeps the u . s . > together as one nation . the glue that keeps the us together as one nation ( if indeed there is such a glue and such a unified nation ) contains many ingredients , among which brute force and economic interests play a much bigger role than english or some other linguistic phenomenon . the unifying powers of police batons and wageloss ( for which one can blame the japanese , or mexicans , or anybody except the american ruling class ) far exceed those of the poems of walt whitman . > by requiring all american children to attend > classes taught in english we are doing our non-native - english speaking > compatriots an enormous favor . clearly the " non-native - english speaking compatriots " cannot be included in the " we " who are doing " our blablabla " a favor when " we " ( and " we " alone ) require all american children to attend classes taught in english . this is what english only truly is about : maintaining or returning to a status quo where " we " make decisions for " our blablabla " whose benefactors " we " thereby are . best , bernhard rohrbacher
<subject> re : 6 . 933 , misc : english only </subject> jack aubert is absolutely correct . the teaching of standard english is a thing that i do not hesitate to say should be compulsory nationwide ( although this does n't necessarily mean that it has to be so via a federal - level mandate . ) i have nothing at all against personal or familial or ethnic bilingualism and i spent a great deal of time and effort to render myself bilingual as a teenager , when the odds were against me . if it were up to me , most people would master a second language in childhood . however , english is an essential ingredient of the glue that binds the u . s . together . it is far more cruel to help non - english speakers in the u . s . to get along without it than it is to require that they learn it ( and to provide the necessary educational infrastructure . ) a substantial majority of formerly-non - english - speaking immigrants to the u . s . hold this position , and if they do not feel denigrated by having to learn english , who are the other " experts " that would claim it is degrading ?

<subject> disc he / she </subject> dear linguist list subscribers , for the continuing discussion of the pronouns , i have some lines of data from the 17 manuscripts of the a - version of piers plowman . they can generally be said to be representative of 15th century usage . is it not strongly suggested in the lines that " proverbial he " , and perhaps the " original " morphology of the so called " generic-he " , was feminine , not masculine ? what a strange thing to say ! can this be accurate ? looking at the middle english pronouns , using the modern paradigm to evaluate them , is misleading and inconclusive . when the development of middle english " his " or " him " is evaluated without taking into consideration their development from old english morphology , much of the story is lost - - that these two " masculine " forms were also neuter , and in this later sense ( " not one or the other " ) , served well for the indefinite singular - - by way of development from the oe masculine / neuter obliques ; and the feminine forms were morphologically related to the plural . in the following lines , the h-stem subject is the feminine ( / plural ) , not the masculine . am i wrong ? ( playing for a moment the devil 's advocate ) do n't these lines below fly in the face of feminist theory as it sees the " he " " stealing cognitive space " , whereas in fact , they are feminine forms ? i would like to have some feminist theory input about these lines of evidence . if so-goes - the-language , so-goes - the-culture ( a la whorf ) , what can we make of the " hers " = 3d " theirs " identity found widespread in middle english morpholgy , and what can we say about the " proverbial he " in the following being feminine ? is there anybody strong in feminist theory , particulary a feminist him - / herself , who can discuss this in the general forum ? is my understanding correct that feminist history sees the h-stem feminine as having dropped from living english by 1300 ? please help . do not hesitate to contact me personally about any aspects of this , pro , con , or indifferent . lines from piers ( * = 3d unavailable character ) passus iii line 229 a = ch and he = feat gripeth gifts , so [ ? ] god helpe , d and ho so gripeth here gifts , so me god helpe , e = deai = feat grypi = fe such gifts , sa me god helpe , h but he = feat gripeth siche 3eftis , so me god helpe , h2 and he = feat grypes here gifts , so me god helpe , h3 = j and he = feat gripi = fe mede , so me god helpe , k and thay = feat grepyn her gifts , so me god helpe , l and ho = feat gripeth heore 3eftes , so me god helpe , m and 3e = feat grypit here 3iftis , so me god helpe , n and he = feat gripeth 3e gift , so me god helpe , r and he = feat grypyt 3oure gifts , so me god helpe , t and he = feat gripi = fe here gifts , so me god helpe , u and he = feat gripeth here gold , so me god helpe , v and heo = feat 3iftus heore gifts , so me god helpe , w he = feat gripeth here 3eftes , so me god helpe passus iii line 230 a schul ab * e it full bitterly or ellis = fee bok lyeth ch shal ab * e bitterly or = fee bok lie * th d shal ab * e it bitterly or = fee bok lyeth e sall ab * e it full bytter as = fee buke tellis h he schal abigge it bitterly or ellis = fee bok li * e = fe h2 shal ab * e it biterly or = fee bok lyeth h3 shal ab * e it bitterly or = fee bok li * e = fe j schulun abugge wel bitterly or = fee bok lyeth k schallen abigge hit wel bitterly or = fee bok lyeth l shal ab * e hit wel bytter or ellis = fee bok lyeth m scholyn abiggyn wol bytter or = fee bok liet n shal ab * e hit wel bitterly ar = fee bok lyeth r shal ab * e ful bitterly or = fee bok lyes t shal ab * ie it bitterly or = fee bok li * e = fe u shal ab * e ful bitere or = fee bok lyes v = deei schullen abugge bitterly or = fee bok li * e = fe w shal ab * e it bitterly or = fee bok ly
<subject> summary : buccalization </subject> several weeks ago i posted a query asking for instances of " buccalization " , the development of a glottal stop into an oral stop . the reason for the query was that i ' m compiling a catalogue of lenition and fortition types for a textbook , and this was the only type in my catalogue i could n't find an example of . i received seven responses . none of them turned up an absolutely ironclad example of a glottal stop developing into an oral stop , though the things that did turn up were nonetheless striking . four languages were cited . maru , a tibeto - burman language , has turned syllable-final zero into [ t ] or [ k ] , depending on the preceding tone . it is possible , but not certain , that this change proceeded via glottal stop . ( robins burling , 1966 , ` the addition of final stops in the history of maru ' , _ language _ 47 : 581-586 ; anatole lyovin , 1968 , ` notes on the addition of final stops in maru ' , _ project on linguistic analysis _ 7 ( berkeley ) . ) mandarin chinese optionally allows syllable-initial zero to be realized as any of several segments , including a glottal stop , a velar nasal , or a velar or uvular voiced continuant . ( yuen - ren chao , _ a grammar of spoken chinese _ , p . 20 . ) there is reason to believe that some of these initial zeros derive from earlier glottal stop . winnebago has undergone the change [ - r ? ] - > [ - t ? - ] between vowels , and , if i understand the reply correctly , the rhotic itself may be epenthetic in origin . american english has its celebrated case of ` no ' > ` nope ' , possibly via glottal stop . the same is true of ` yep ' , if this derives directly from ` yeah ' and is not analogical . ( and i have noted that i myself sometimes have ` welp ' for ` well ' . ) that 's it . it really does look as if the glottal region is a vast sink from which no segment ever returns . it is not obvious why this should be so , since , as one respondent points out , the development of [ ? ] to [ p ] , [ t ] or [ k ] under the influence of neighboring [ u ] , [ i ] or [ a ] does not seem intrinsically implausible , and indeed it is reported that early european linguists working in southeast asia sometimes misheard and mistranscribed glottal stops in exactly this manner . my thanks to richard coates , lance eccles , james kirchner , bill mahota , john koontz , david solnit and scott delancey for their responses . perhaps i should also have inquired about cases of [ h ] > oral segment , but i did n't think of it . any further information in this vein will be gratefully received . larry trask cogs university of sussex brighton bn1 9qh uk larryt @ cogs . susx . ac . uk

<subject> disc : the parameter of aspect </subject> " on the parameter of aspect " this posting continues the fruitful exchange subsequent to the initial book review of c . smith 's 1991 " the parameter of aspect " . in a follow-up to that review , i noted an alternative to smith 's proposal involving a simpler binary parameter for aspect that was in part the basis for my 1995 dissertation on the biblical hebrew verbal system ( u of toronto ) . smith 's reply pointed out the apparent empirical disconfirmation by mandarin and navajo ( treated in her work among others ) ; and this is where we pick up the thread . i do not grant the traditional analysis of navajo and especially mandarin chinese that is the basis of the objection ; nor do i grant the traditional analysis of the " oriental " languages including burmese , japanese , and above all , biblical hebrew representing the classical semitic systems . the earliest layer of the quasi-consensus on tense , mood and aspect ( tma ) , flowing from comrie 1976 , 1985 to present , is the early 19th century " orientalist " framework that posits ( a ) " tenseless " languages or " inflectional aspect " systems , and ( b ) a definition of " perfectivity " based on the ambiguity inherent in the concept of " completion " ( global view as well as relative past tense ) ; on " oriental " and " orientalism " , see e . g . , e . said 's " orientalism " 1978 . i reject the orientalist framework and the analysis of semitic systems which was extended to other " oriental " systems , which was extended worldwide to at least half of the world 's systems ; i indirectly reject the traditional analysis of mandarin and navajo . to clarify and make the discussion more concrete , i offer an analysis of english in the orientalist framework ( * please * do not take this seriously as an analysis of english ) . english , as all reputable authorities agree , is " tenseless " : it encodes only " aspect " ( cf . slavic systems ) . not only do we find arrested development , but actual regression from the robust classical aryan tma systems . english has but one distinction : - ed vs - s / - 0 , respectively perfective and imperfective . the perfective signals " completion " vs the non-completion of the imperfective . the severely impoverished system of english signals the regression of the anglo - american mind ( witness reagan and thatcher , etc . , etc . ) . we note several key elements that underlie all traditional analyses of so-called " tenseless " languages . 1 ) tma is encoded morphologically on the greek model or not at all : the " morphocentric fallacy . " 2 ) the perfective is defined as relative past tense ( bypassing the revolution in aspectology in the second half of the 1800s ) : the " aorist fallacy . " 3 ) the relative hierarchy of languages , with greek and sanskrit on top , semitic near the bottom , and now the creoles on the bottom , related to the relative development of " mind " and tied to a particular pre - darwinian interpretation of evolutionary theory . english is not tenseless , nor is biblical hebrew or quranic arabic , nor is japanese , nor burmese , nor turkish , nor indeed mohawk or haitian creole . they do differ from the standard european systems : they systematically differ with respect to aspect in mirror-image fashion . this difference is insightfully captured by cowper 's strong claim for a simple binary parameter for aspect : a system default 's for an aspectual interpretation of its simple tense system , either perfective or non-perfective . the aspect not " defaulted for " is separately encoded ( cross-linguistically in a limited number of ways ) . european " tense " systems default for the non-perfective ( apparently the minority or marked option ) ; non - european " tenseless " systems default for the perfective as does english . i simply extrapolate to a strong claim for universal grammar : all systems encode tense ( past vs non-past ; i do not grant a " future tense " ) , and at least irrealis / realis ; and in addition the basic system is configured by the binary parameter for aspect . virtually all systems outside of the european sphere default for the perfective according to my studies ; and i assume that is the unmarked setting for ug . the major diagnostic among many is the ( non - ) obligatory expression of the progressive : the perfective default must separately encode the progressive . e . g . , mandarin must express the progressive by the zai v construction ( lit . " at v " ) : it defaults for the perfective . navajo and apparently the athabaskan family as a whole default for the non-perfective ( with algonquian systems , the only real pocket of european - like non-perfective defaulters ) . this work is summarized in my " tenseless languages in light of an aspectual parameter for universal grammar : a preliminary cross - linguistic survey " , forthcoming fall 1995 , toronto working papers in linguistics . this does not mean that individual lexica cannot increase the complexity of the system , nor that the many interactions between tma and lexical classes are not also parameterized . i ' m only talking about the basic configuration of the tma system for ug . smith is right to point to great complexity inherent in the systems she described in her last posting . re mandarin . the difficulty is what counts as " inflection " , and whether " inflection " is not infl of standard theorizing . i recognize mandarin - le as inflection ; but not - guo , - zhe ( smith does not mention v - ( yi - ) v , nor does she include v1-v2 compounds ) . the literature i use is divided on the morphosyntactic status of - guo . but - zhe , i think , does not in any way behave as " inflection " : see among many sources , li , thompson , " the meaning and structure of complex sentences with - zhe in mandarin chinese " jaos 96 . 4 ( 1976 ) . it certainly is not a " progressive " ; but is perhaps some sort of " adjectivalization " . re navajo . i think the jury is still out on these systems . but rice 's work on slave indicates the lexical nature of several classes of morphemes in the athabaskan verb complex . there is indeed a great deal of complexity here . and since athabaskan is really the only system that does not fall out naturally from my proposal , it deserves great attention . either the whole project falls through , or we learn something interesting about athabaskan systems , or the proposal gets modified in an interesting way : who knows . we learn nothing without strong claims . in summary : i reject any analysis that is " tenseless " ; and / or defines perfectivity in terms of relative past tense ( with comrie 1976 ) . these views embedded in the current consensus on tma can be easily traced to the early 1800s and the work on hebrew and arabic . i reject that early framework ( and the not-so - pretty cultural baggage that goes with it ) . in its place i place cowper 's binary aspectual parameter default , and extend the proposal not only to the other " oriental " systems but to a strong claim for ug 's tma system . according to my surveys , the only real problem is what to do with athabaskan systems : a project for the near future ( i hope ) . i note that many proposals under other approaches would benefit from the reduction and simplification of terms , concepts , etc . e . g . , bybee et al 's system can be streamlined ; and symmetries emerge that appear amenable to explanation . descriptive / typological work is put on a better footing as well . respectfully , vincent decaen c / o near eastern studies dept 4 bancroft ave . , 3d floor university of toronto toronto on m5s 1a1 canada or decaen @ epas . utoronto . ca

<subject> summary : polish phonology </subject> not too long ago i posted a request for polish informants who were also linguists in the hope of getting some quick responses to some questions about polish phonology which are not fully addressed in the literature . the response has been tremendous . since the details may not be of interest , and since i am not sure if all respondents want their names used , i will summarize as follows : most respondents report having a contrast between the sequences [ k ' e ] and [ kje ] as well as [ g ' e ] and [ gje ] , where by [ k ' ] and [ g ' ] i mean a fronted velar probably not quite as front as ipa [ c ] , though . a minority of respondents report no contrast , which is apparently the result of a very recent and presumably spreading sound change . of those speakers who do have the contrast , most report also having a similar contrast between [ x ' e ] and [ xje ] sequences , although one or two do not . it is this last contrast , [ x ' e ] vs . [ xje ] ( both distinct also from [ xe ] ) which is of special interest because in attested forms it only appears before one suffix , a rather peculiar one at that . the suffix is spelled - ewicz and it forms last names such as stankiewicz or banachiewicz . it is also clear that such names come from eastern poland , and that the [ x ' e ] pronunciation is thus a borrowing into standard polish from some eastern dialects and ultimately from east slavic ( belorussian / ukrainian ) . synchronically , however , it is a genuine contrast and one of special interest to those phonologists who are interested in the universals governing the possible systems of contrasts ( e . g . , in lexical phonology 's structure preservation , ) . great thanks to everybody who has responded so far . once i verify whether i am authorized to publicize people 's names i will post a " nonymous " acknowledgement . any additional information on this topic would be welcome . alexis mr

( playing for a moment the devil 's advocate ) do n't these lines below fly in the face of feminist theory as it sees the " he " " stealing cognitive space " , whereas in fact , they are feminine forms ? i would like to have some feminist theory input about these lines of evidence . if so-goes - the-language , so-goes - the-culture ( a la whorf ) , what can we make of the " hers " = " theirs " identity found widespread in middle english morpholgy , and what can we say about the " proverbial he " in the following being feminine ? is there anybody strong in feminist theory , particulary a feminist him - / herself , who can discuss this in the general forum ? is my understanding correct that feminist history sees the h-stem feminine as having dropped from living english by 1300 ? please help . do not hesitate to contact me personally about any aspects of this , pro , con , or indifferent . lines from piers ( * = unavailable character ) passus iii line 229 a ch and he that gripeth gifts , so [ ? ] god helpe , d and ho so gripeth here gifts , so me god helpe , e thai that grypith such gifts , sa me god helpe , h but he that gripeth siche 3eftis , so me god helpe , h2 and he that grypes here gifts , so me god helpe , h3 j and he that gripith mede , so me god helpe , k and thay thatat grepyn her gifts , so me god helpe , l and ho that gripeth heore 3eftes , so me god helpe , m and 3e that grypit here 3iftis , so me god helpe , n and he that gripeth 3e gift , so me god helpe , r and he that grypyt 3oure gifts , so me god helpe , t and he that gripith here gifts , so me god helpe , u and he that gripeth here gold , so me god helpe , v and heo that 3iftus heore gifts , so me god helpe , w he that gripeth here 3eftes , so me god helpe passus iii line 230 a schul ab * e [ abide ] it full bitterly or ellis the bok lyeth ch shal ab * e bitterly or the bok lie * th d shal ab * e it bitterly or the bok lyeth e sall ab * e it full bytter as the buke tellis h he schal abigge it bitterly or ellis the bok li * eth h2 shal ab * e it biterly or the bok lyeth h3 shal ab * e it bitterly or the bok li * eth j schulun abugge wel bitterly or the bok lyeth k schallen abigge hit wel bitterly or the bok lyeth l shal ab * e hit wel bytter or ellis the bok lyeth m scholyn abiggyn wol bytter or the bok liet n shal ab * e hit wel bitterly ar the bok lyeth r shal ab * e ful bitterly or the bok lyes t shal ab * ie it bitterly or the bok li * eth u shal ab * e ful bitere or the bok lyes v thei schullen abugge bitterly or the bok li * eth w shal ab * e it bitterly or the bok ly

<subject> re : 6 . 943 , disc : non - decimal counting systems </subject> members may be interested in the work of dr glendon lean ( a past colleague of mine in png ) who passed away in march this year after recording his work of 22 years on the counting systems of papua new guinea and oceania . he documented in 24 appendices ( bound in four volumes ) counting systems of over 883 languages , most of which were not a simple base 10 cycle . on top of this , his thesis also suggested that the origins of counting systems are to be found in indigenous cultures and while they were spread they may have also spontaneously developed . he included records of body tally systems in which numbers were also used for parts of the body in an orderly system ; cycles of every number up to ten except seven and nine ( i think from memory ) with many having secondary cycles . he covered austronesian languages and papuan languages . printed copies of the volumes of appendices are available from chris wilkins , dept . of mathematics and statistics , png university of technology , lae , private mail bag , papua new guinea . professor alan bishop , education , monash university melbourne is also able to assist with information on this . i am hoping to look at some further mathematical connections in languages in east timor . if anyone has any information on this , could you please email me . thank you , dr kay owens , faculty of education , university of western sydney , macarthur , po box 555 , campbelltown , nsw 2560 australia .
<subject> re : struck out by nomo </subject> the symbol k was used in early baseball box scores , indicating that the batter had struck out . this abbreviation was probably originated around 1850 by henry chadwick who " introduced the newspaper box score so that one player 's performance could be fairly measured against another 's . " chadwick was a british born newspaperman who is described in ken burns ' baseball as baseball 's " chief arbiter , publicist , and goad " who was the country 's first baseball editor , working for the new york clipper and for the brooklyn eagle for nearly fifty years . he also wrote chadwick 's baseball manual that standardized the rules , etc . of the early game .

<subject> re : banning of german </subject> while flipping through random books at the linguistics library , i fell over something that would be interesting to this discussion . i have n't been following this thread , so this might have been mentioned before . i found a reference to the us supreme court reports , 1922 october term , meyer vs . nebraska , p . 392 - - 403 in steinberg ( 1993 ) an introduction to psycholinguistics , longman . i ' ll quote the passage in full , as it is so well written . it 's in the beginning of chapter 8 . " in may of 1920 , in hamilton county , nebraska , a rural area of the united states , a teacher , mr robert meyer , was arrested for violating state law . mayer had been teaching bible stories in german at zion parochial school to a 10 - year-old boy . nebraska law forbade the teaching of a second language to children under the age of 13 . not only nebraska but 21 other states as well prohibited the teaching of foreign languages , except 'd ead ' languages such as latin and greek . according to nebraska 's 1919 siman act , ' no person . . . shall teach any subject to any person in any language other than the english language . languages other than english may be taught only after a pupil shall have . . . passed the eighth grade . . . . any person who violates any of the provisions of this act shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and , upon conviction , shall be subject to a fine of not less than twenty-five dollars ( $ 25 ) , nor more than one hundred dollars ( $ 100 ) or be confined in the county jail for any period not exceeding thirty days for each offense . ' if found guilty , meyer could have been fined or even sent to jail . the states had passed these laws essentially with the german language as the target , america had just finished a war with germany and there was a hatred of germany and things german , particularly its military values , ideals and political institutions . the law reflected the widespread belief that the german language was the embodiment of all that was evil in german culture and that to teach such a language to young americans would be immoral and corrupting . meyer decided to appeal his case to the supreme court of the state of nebraska . ironically , lawyers for the state of nebraska took essentially the position presented in the german language by the german philosopher , wilhelm von humboldt , in 1836 . that is , a language by its very nature represents the spirit and national character of a people . if this were true , then by teaching them the grammar , structure and vocabulary of the german language , meyer could indeed have been harming american children by making them into german militarists right there on the plains of nebraska . the nebraska supreme court denied meyer 's appeal , but meyer did not submit . he then took his case to the highest court in the country , the united states supreme court , where he won his case . that court overturned his conviction and declared unconstitutional all laws in the united states which forbade the teaching of a foreign language . in its 1922 ruling the court stated as one basis for its decision . ' mere knowledge of the german language cannot reasonably be regarded as harmful . ' we see in this story that a seemingly purely theoretical issue can have very practical consequences in everyday life . in making a legal decision on the matter , the court also made a psycholinguistic decision , on the relationship of language , thought and culture . was the court correct ? it is this question that we shall now consider .

<subject> on language and separatism </subject> on linguist vol-6 - 955 , jelly julia ( julia @ let . rug . nl ) says : " basque and catalan separatism is not based on language . why do we never hear " anything about galician separatism on the iberian peninsula ? galician is a " language very different from spanish ( and not so different from portuguese ) . " the name of the region is galicia and is part of spain . galician is a language " much older than spanish itself : it was used for poetry and by the kings in " ancient times . still , we do not hear a lot about galician separatism . neither " do we hear anything about leonese separatism , aragonese separatism , andalusian " separatism , simply because it does not exist . separatism on the peninsula has " nothing to do with language . it has everything to do with historic rights of " old kingdoms . galician separatism exists . it just simply does n't reach the news because galician separatists ( a minority ) have n't killed people , even though they ' ve tried to on a couple of occasions . on the contrary , galician separatists ( and federalists ) have been killed by the spanish army and police ( during franco 's uprising and regime ) . there are galician separatists in the jails of the spanish kingdom . the spiral of stret and institutional violence is benefitial to the western democratic states . separatism in the iberian peninsula , as elsewhere , has to do with the way peoples view ( or are led to view ) their own identity in opposition to other identities . language is most often , if not always , an issue . as for galiza , to the extent that the spanish state is able to keep the lid on the language issue by taming the language of galiza ( portuguese ) and turning it into a domestic " galician " , no problem - - galiza won't reach the news . galiza , as many other minorized cultures of the world , is caught between two states : spain and portugal . what the kingdom of spain and , particularly , its representatives in galiza ( the majority of the local political and intellectual elites ) can't cope with is the fact that another state 's language , portuguese , is spoken ( and written as such , by a small fraction of the elites ) within spanish territory . legislative , administrative , and judicial measures have been taken to silence some intellectuals , writers , and teachers who support , with rational arguments , the view that " galician " is just a set of regional and social varieties of portuguese , and therefore it should be written with the portuguese orthography . these acts of actual repression , discrimination and censorship by the mechanisms of the spanish state do n't reach the news either . the situation of the " language question " in galiza nowadays is the furthest one could imagine from a civilized , technical and political debate on how to articulate and reconcile galician identity / ies with galiza 's language . it is discouraging and worrisome to see how the term " reintegrationist " , which refers to those who seek the effective recognition of galician as a part of its natural linguistic domain , portuguese , is being thrown around as an insult in public and academic discourse . i should clarify that the separatist / reintegrationist lines intersect each other . that is , there are galician separatists or nationalists who are reintegrationists and use the portuguese orthography , and then there are other separatists and nationalists who are very happy with the institutionally-supported view of galician as a " separate language " to be written , however , with a spanish - based orthography . in the meantime , galician portuguese is being learned less and less as a first language . but that 's not the real issue . celso alvarez - caccamo lxalvarz @ udc . es
<subject> sum : had better </subject> dear linguists , on behalf of my friend , i asked you to check the sentences about _ had better not _ , _ had better not _ , etc . here are his summary below . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * at the end of may , i raised a query about the acceptability of the following sentences .

( 5 ) i spent all day working on the tv . it had better work now . ( 6 ) joe : i can explain why i am late . jane : this had better be good some people say that _ this had better be good _ is a cliche and in ( 6 ) it implies the speaker kas expectations that the excuse will be fanciful or just plain untrue . i would like to thank again to all the people who reponded . if you had any comments on this matter , please email through prof . tanaka to me . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * best wishes , hiroaki tanaka , associate professor , tokushima university , japan hiro-t @ ias . tokushima-u . ac . jp

<subject> query : chomsky 's " single mutation " </subject> on page 43 of his 1977 paper ` language origin theories ' , in duane rumbaugh 's book _ language learning by a chimpanzee _ , gordon hewes asserts that chomsky has explicitly attributed the human language faculty to a single genetic mutation in our ancestors . he gives as his source " chomsky ( 1967 ) " , but , exasperatingly , neither this work nor any other work by chomsky is listed in his bibliography , nor is it obvious what work he might have been citing . can anyone point me to any places in chomsky 's writings ( or , indeed , in anyone else 's writings ) in which such a suggestion is explicitly made ? all i ' ve been able to find is chomsky 's repeated suggestions that our language faculty might have arisen as a by-product of other developments and hence as something not subject to natural selection , but that 's not quite the same thing . larry trask cogs university of sussex brighton bn1 9qh england larryt @ cogs . susx . ac . uk

<subject> case studies needed </subject> dear colleagues , i ' m preparing to teach an introductory course in language variation , and i 'd like to get your help ( again ) . could you recommend any case studies , either from published sources or from your own experience , that would be appropriate for class discussion ? what i ' m looking for in a case study is a description of a real situation , preferably a somewhat controversial one . ideally , it would include some background information , a description of the conflicts involved , the sequence of events up to a point where a decision is needed , and a description of the actual decision taken . since the course is on language variation , relevant case studies would include anecdotes on discrimination in the workplace or in the educational system because of language choice or dialect choice , or cases involving difficult decisions in language planning or language legislation . i ' ve never used case studies before , so advice and comments are also welcome ! my address is mkuha @ silver . ucs . indiana . edu thanks for your help . mai kuha

<subject> bilingualism </subject> i ' m not sure why , but i was reluctant to post on the issue of us bilingualism . in any case , i feel obliged to say this as an educational linguist who has worked in esl and tangentially in bilingual ed teacher education . first of all , the entire notion that bilingual ed was , is , or could be ( designed as ) a method for introducing national plurilingualism is a nonstarter . therefore any debates about it using plurilingualism as argument get nowhere . in fact , with out a wish to flame anyone ( because i do n't think it was intentional ) the entire argument that we should stop bilingual ed because of its anti - english or anti-standard english agenda is of a kind very familiar to us in educational circles . it 's little different than what we hear from those who argue that proponents of progressive educational idea x ( e . g . whole langauge reading instruction , process writing , outcomes-based ed . ) are trying to bring down standards , undermine society , do something unamerican , and so on . it is essentially a rhetorical manipulation of the worst kind , based on false suppositions , and intended to push hot buttons . by saying this i am not defending bilingual ed or any other movement . however , i think these need to be debated on their educational merits . why is the argument a nonstarter ? admittedly , there are those in education who propose that students have the right to their own dialect language or what-have - you , and that they should n't have to learn standard english in school . however , they are largely involved in an academic exercise that takes place in the pages of journals of various sorts . they do not shape policy . the avowed purpose of the vast majority of bilingual ed programs is usually to ease a limited english proficient child into the mainstream . the idea is that if they take content area courses in their first language they will not fall behind while learning english . the programs contain esl components that supposedly will allow the kids to mainstream later . some programs do encourage native language literacy and continue classes native language classes throughout a child 's school career . some take very young english speaking kids and put them into these classes on an immersion basis . since usually older english speaking kids in other schools are trying , in theory , to learn the same language the immigrant kids are already fluent in , i fail to see what is controversial about that . it seems to be designed , in theory again , to encourage personal , not societal , bilingualism . the failings of bilingual ed , in places where it has failed , have more to do with poor educational practice than with policy . if kids are arriving at college after say five years in bilingual ed , and are entering esl programs , something did n't work right . to anyone remotely familiar with urban schools , that should hardly be a surprise . now , on a national level i think we should look at us bilingualism and forget about catalonia or the basque country for a moment . bilingualism in the us has endured over many generations in several situations : ( i ) tight - knit religious communities : hasidic jews who speak yiddish , old order amish , brethren , and mennonites , who speak their german dialects . ( ii ) groups who were overtaken , to put it nicely , by english speakers : the navajo and other indigenious peoples ; french creole speakers in louisiana , spanish in the southwest . ( iii ) isolated communities : gullah in south carolina and georgia . immigrants , it would seem , tend to assimilate linguistically over a few , typically very few generations . in spite of the myth that spanish - speakers are somehow different on this score , i think , it would be instructive to look at the case of new york , which is full of people young hispanics who cannot speak more than a few words of spanish - this in spite of continuing immigration from spanish - speaking countries . as a non - yiddish or hebrew speaking ashkanazi jew , i entirely understand this phenomenon although as a learner of spanish as a foreign language , i lament the lost opportunity . finally , i think it would be more instructive to look at which americans feel threatened by the non-existent threat of the demise of something that has never existed ( the us as a monolingual nation ) and try to figure out why people feel that way . why , for example , is it an issue in the west and not in new york ? why is it associated with right and not the left ? why has it come up now again ? is it it really just good old american nativism , ' 90s style , or is there something different going on ? also , why have n't we in linguistics and education done more to communicate with mainstream americans that the whole thing is a lot of nonsense ? michael newman dept . of educational theory & practice the ohio state university mnewman @ magnus . acs . ohio-state . edu
<subject> english only </subject> i found the remarks of johanna rubba in a recent issue ( 6 . 967 ) to be very worthwhile and to the point . i would like to add a couple of points . in the vast majority of immigrants to the united states , the typical pattern of language acquisition is : the first generation may or may not learn english ; the second generation learns english natively and the parents ' language to varying degrees of proficiency ; the third generation learns only english - - and this is without any legislative intervention . there are strong pedagogical and psycholinguistic reasons for bilingual education programs for school-age immigrants and unassimilated children of immigrants . it is far easier to ` ` learn to read ' ' ( in the general sense , not in the sense of learning to read a particular language ) in one 's native language , and then learn to read the second language , than it is to learn to read ( in the second language ) and to learn the second language at the same time . - stuart luppescu | university of chicago | a foreign language is ` ` a weapon in sl70 @ cicero . spc . uchicago . edu | in the struggle for life .

<subject> discussion : english only </subject> one point that jack aubert made in his recent posting is dead on : quite apart from any putative intention on the part of policy makers , in the u . s . today " bilingualism " rarely means the ability to speak two languages fluently . i ' m thinking particularly about so - - called bilingual classes in our public schools , where many people get their first notion of what this word refers to . i have enrolled my children in these classes whenever possible , but with this decision comes the responsibility to attempt to convince administrators that native speakers of english must be required to learn some spanish in these classes . ( the bilingual classes at my children 's schools are always spanish - - english . ) it has never been expected in any of the bilingual classes my kids have been in that they should be studying two languages too ! these classes are run as a one-way street - - - and everyone knows it . as one little girl ( required to enroll ) in my daughter 's class told me , " bilingual means you ' re dumb . " hmmmmmmmmmm what people say the word ` bilingual ' means in your standard want ad is probably too hot an issue to handle . ( is this a new ` ` urban myth ' ' that such ads are actually seeking people of certain ethnicity ? ) i suspect that the term is coming to mean something quite different than its traditional denotation , and sometime soon we ' ll find that the word ` ` bilingual ' ' activates a number of presuppositions about both mastery of english and ethnic identity , not unlike what happened to the term ` ` illegal immigrant ' ' , as was demonstrated in various reports which were released at the time of the debate on prop 187 . this sort of change in the use of the word ` bilingual ' will not help anyone whose goal is to encourage the study and use of more than one language in the u . s . because non - - experts , if they do not control language policy , are certainly involved in that policy making . i suggest that the way to combat it is very local action : take the time to talk to the principal ( s ) of your local public elementary school ( s ) . robin schafer rschafer @ ucsd . edu
<subject> english only </subject> in a recent posting , sxren harder ( sharder @ ling . hum . aau . dk ) brings up an interesting point ( quoting from steinberg ( 1993 ) " an introduction to psycholinguistics " ) : > the law reflected the widespread belief that the german language was the > embodiment of all that was evil in german culture and that to teach such > a language to young americans would be immoral and corrupting . > . . . lawyers for the state of nebraska took essentially the position > . . . [ that ] a language by its very nature represents the spirit and > national character of a people . if this were true , then by teaching them > the grammar , structure and vocabulary of the german language , meyer could > indeed have been harming american children by making them into german > militarists right there on the plains of nebraska . - interesting , because in several recent postings against the english - only movement , an argument was given that teaching foreign _ languages _ was good because it exposed students to other _ cultures _ . that is precisely the reason the teaching of the german language was banned , according to the above quote . i think most of us would agree that the state of nebraska was wrong ; teaching another language does not serve to any great extent to pass on the culture . but if you believe that , are n't you being hypocritical to believe that teaching foreign languages is good because it exposes students to other cultures ? fwiw , i have a personal opinion : if you want to expose students to other cultures , it would be much better to teach ethnography than language . ( better yet , send the students to non-tourist areas of other countries . but i doubt whether the us educational system is prepared for that ! )
<subject> " english plus " resolution in congress </subject> the " english - plus " resolution below was introduced into the house of representative on july 13 by rep . jose serrano ( d - n . y . ) , along with 31 other democratic cosponsors and one republican , ileana ros - lehtinen ( fla . ) . it is a nonbinding statement of policy intended as counter to six english - only bills now pending in congress . ( these measures include the king bill , h . r . 1005 , which would declare english the official language , end bilingual education and bilingual ballots , and require all government business to be transacted in english ; and the only slightly less restrictive emerson bill , h . r . 123 , which likewise declares english the official language and ends all federal funding for bilingual education . the emerson bill has more than 120 sponsors and is held to be likely to pass this year ; hearings will probably be scheduled once the present conflicts over the budget are resolved . ) some opponents of english - only measures have felt that the wording of this resolution is not as strong as they would like , particularly as it makes only indirect reference to bilingual education programs . still , its passage would have an important symbolic effect , and even if it should be defeated in committee , it will at least help to draw the battle lines over this issue . the lsa executive committee voted at its meeting this may to give its support to this resolution ; and in a mail ballot a few years ago the membership of the society declared its opposition to english - only measures by a margin of 94 to 6 percent . individual linguists may want to make their views on the english - plus resolution known to members of the house committee on economic and educational opportunities , whose names follow the text of the resolution below . committee members can be reached at : the honorable _ _ _ _ _ _ _ u . s . house of representatives washington , dc 20515 geoff nunberg concurrent resolution entitled , the ` ` english plus resolution ' ' . whereas english is the primary language of the united states , and all members of the society recognize the importance of english to national life and individual accomplishment ; whereas many residents of the united states speak native languages other than english , including many languages indigenous to this country , and these linguistic resources should be conserved and developed ; whereas this nation was founded on a commitment to democratic principles , and not on racial , ethnic , or religious homogeneity , and has drawn strength from a diversity of languages and cultures and from a respect for individual liberties ; whereas multilingualism , or the ability to speak languages in addition to english , is a tremendous resource to the united states because such ability enhances american competitiveness in global markets by permitting improved communication and cross-cultural understanding between producers and suppliers , vendors and clients , retailers and consumers ; whereas multilingualism improves united states diplomatic efforts by fostering enhanced communication and greater understanding between nations ; whereas multilingualism has historically been an essential element of national security , including the use of native american languages in the development of coded communications during world war ii , the korean war , and the vietnam war ; whereas multilingualism promotes greater cross-cultural understanding between different racial and ethnic groups in the united states ; whereas there is no threat to the status of english in the united states , a language that is spoken by 94 percent of united states residents , according to the 1990 united states census , and there is no need to designate any official united states language or to adopt similar restrictionist legislation ; whereas ` ` english - only ' ' measures , or proposals to designate english as the sole official language of the united states , would violate traditions of cultural pluralism , divide communities along ethnic lines , jeopardize the provision of law enforcement , public health , education , and other vital services to those whose english is limited , impair government efficiency , and undercut the national interest by hindering language skills needed to enhance international competitiveness and conduct diplomacy ; and whereas such ` ` english - only ' ' measures would represent an unwarranted federal regulation of self-expression , abrogate constitutional rights to freedom of expression and equal protection of the laws , violate international human rights treaties to which the united states is a signatory , and contradict the spirit of the 1923 supreme court case meyer v . nebraska , wherein the court declared that ` ` the protection of the constitution extends to all ; to those who speak other languages as well as to those born with english on the tongue ' ' ; now , therefore , be it resolved by the house of representatives ( the senate concurring ) , that the united states government should pursue policies that - - ( 1 ) encourage all residents of this country to become fully proficient in english by expanding educational opportunities ;

<subject> comparatives </subject> summary : intensification of the comparative i had in may on the list ( 8 . 758 ) a query on the intensification of comparative forms in different languages . here comes the summary related to the query ( i am sorry about the slight delay ! ) . as i noted earlier , my better linguistic competence limits to germanic languages plus finnish where in all the comparative ( of adjective , adverb , quantitative pronoun ) is typically intensified with an adverb denoting some form of totality : 1 . a . the train went faster . b . the train went ever faster . ( also : all the faster ) 2 . a . der zug fuhr schneller . b . der zug fuhr immer schneller . 3 . a . ta ' get gick fortare . b . ta ' get gick allt fortare . 4 . a . juna meni lujempaa . b . juna meni yha " lujempaa . ( also : aina lujempaa ) the intensifiers , e . g . ever in english , are in all these cases some kind of universal quantifiers , the content being approximately ' always ' or ' all the way ' ( see e . g . vendler ) . since the pattern shows some regularity , i was curious to gather information about functionally corresponding expressions in other languages . indeed , i did receive some further parallel examples , and moreover , there was some discussion about the appropriateness of the english example i had in the query ( 1b above ) . many thanks to the people who responded : ewb2 @ cornell . edu ( e . wayles browne ) larry horn < lhorn @ yalevm . ycc . yale . edu > ton van der wouden < vdwouden @ let . rug . nl > allan wechsler < awechsle @ bbn . com > knud lambrecht < lambrec @ uts . cc . utexas . edu > adiego lajara < adiego @ lingua . fil . ub . es > asya pereltsvaig < asya @ mail . netvision . net . il > " j . l . sancho , instituto de lexicografia " < sancho @ crea . rae . es > waruno mahdi < mahdi @ fhi-berlin . mpg . de > bark @ compunet . net ( gerald a . barker md ) philip grew < pgrew @ compuserve . com > as always , my wordings were a bit too implicit in the beginning . there are , of course , several ways of intensifying ( or modifying ) the comparative . a very normal form would be intensification of the degree , e . g . 5 . he is much faster than the rest of the guys . two individuals possessing a quality may also be compared with each other and one of the qaulities intensified in relation to the other : 6 . jack is fast but bob is even faster . perhaps it was my swedish perspective that led to the too general and implicit use of the label ' comparative intensifier ' . it seems , namely , that swedish has in allt ( see 3 above ) an adverb that may be used as an intensifier only with the comparative ( other adverbs may also be used but this is a kind of a prototype , as one can understand on the basis of wessen 's grammar , for instance ) , whereas the general intensifier mycket ( ' much ' , ' very ' ) may be used both with the positive and the comparative ( type 5 then ) . the distribution is not perhaps as strict in all languages and with all expressions . as regards , for example , finnish yha " , it may be used in other contexts too , but it seems that it has a more specialized ( grammaticized ? ) intensifying function when modifying a comparative , e . g . 7 . a . jaana on yha " kaunis . time adv . ' jane is still beautiful ' b . jaanasta tulee yha " kauniimpi . intensifer ' jane becomes ever more beautiful ' but this shows only that intensifiers that merely relate to the comparative do have a temporal implication . as a consequence , it seems that the comparative expresses a dynamic quality ( or degree ) that is opposed to the more stable positions of the positive and the superlative degrees ; the comparative represents a step in one direction but not to a definite point on a scale . the temporal intensifiers of the comparative focus on this implication of dynamism which , in turn , is often associated with successive development , change or process ( cf . the dynamism of verbs ) . moreover , the succession is signalled to be constant and ever-present - - and here we find the motivation of the universal quantifiers ( literally ever ) typically used with the comprative . we might want to look at some examples provided by the respondents ( the names of which are given in appropriate language sections below ) : * * * * * - - dutch : 8 . a . de trein ging sneller b . de trein ging alsmaar sneller c . de trein ging steeds sneller * steeds * and * alsmaar * ( also written as * almaar * ) are universal temporal quantifiers ( over a restricted domain - * altijd * is more unrestrictive ) . ton van der wouden - - - spanish : 9 . el tren iba cada vez ma 's ra ' pido " cada vez " , lit . " each time " catalan : 10 . el tren anava cada vegada / cada cop me 's ra ` pid " cada vegada , cada cop " , lit . " each time " nb : a ' , e ' etc . : vowels with acute accent ; a ` , o ` = vowels with grave accent . ignasi - xavier adiego - - - - italian : 11 . il treno andava sempre piu veloce . what i suspect will interest you here is that 's tandard ' italian ( like most other romance dialects , as i assume you will be told by readers expert in those ) uses the word that translates " always " ( sempre ) as the comparative intensifier you asked about . philip grew - - - russian : 12 . poezd exal bystree . train went faster [ more felicitous if the individual compared to is explicit as in 13 . ] 13 . poezd exal bystree chem mashina train went faster than car 14 . poezd exal vse bystree . train went all faster ' the train went ever faster ' asya pereltsvaig - - - croatian : 15 . a . vlak je is " ao brz " e . train aux went faster - adverb b . vlak je is " ao sve brz " e ( i brz " e ) . serbian : 16 . a . voz je is " ao brz " e . b . voz je is " ao sve brz " e ( i brz " e ) . s " , z " = letters with hac " ek on top . sve ' all ' neuter singular nom . / acc . wayles browne - - - in indonesian , the situation is a bit different , compare : 17 . a . kere ' taapi berjalan lebih cepat train | go - stat | mod | fast " the train goes / went faster " ( i . e . it went faster than the car , horse , other train ) b . kere ' taapi berjalan makin cepat train | go - stat | mod | fast " the train goes / went ever faster " ( i . e . it went constantly faster than it itself did in the preceding moment ( s ) ) where : e ' is &eacute ; ( pronounced like french &egrave ; , ipa epsilon ; ) e is pronounced like french e , ipa @ [ upside-down " e " ] ) c is pronounced like english ch , italian ci stat = stative ( expresses verbal " action " as state of being ) mod = modifier goes / went - there is no category of tense in indonesian , and time of " action " is expressed circumstantially , by adverbs , circumstantial phrases , etc . , also of course by context etc . so , in indonesian we do not intesify the comparative degree of comparison , but have a distinct accelerative " degree of comparison " . the complete paradigm is : comparative : _ lebih cepat _ " faster " accelerative : _ makin cepat _ " ever faster " intensive : _ sangat cepat _ " very fast " superlative : _ paling cepat _ " ( the ) fastest " excessive : _ terlalu cepat _ " too fast " insufficient : _ kurang cepat _ " not fast enough " negative : _ tidak cepat _ " not fast " strictly speaking , of course , this should probably not be seen as the set of forms of degrees of comparison , but a set of adjectival modifiers in combination with an adjective . waruno mahdi * * * * the above cases confirm the pattern that comparative forms tend to be intensified with a universal quatifier if its dynamic implications are to be amplified . the term ' accelerative ' in context of indonesian is illustrative - - although not totally accurate : it is also the only adjectival modification category that is associated with the comparative in the translation ( apart from comparative ' proper ' ) . one could think that the discussed expressions represent a " special case " of comparison , since there is not usually any explicit reference point in the expressions of the ' ever faster ' type ( i . e . a than - complement ) . that is why browne terms the use " free comparative " . on the other hand , there is nothing unusual in the use of this comparative ; it seems to be an application of the temporal comparative as in , for instance : 18 . jack has become faster than before . koenig suggests instead the term " cumulative comparative " , since the development is related to the temporal and the reference is often clearly enough understood in the context ( the term could be better for the indonesian ' accelerative ' too ) : 19 . jack has become ever faster . could in principle be a thinkable notional parallel to 18 ( cf . also 17b above ) . now , 19 ( and 1b for that matter ) may be a bit odd for english speakers , having seen the reactions on ever in my original query . ever is as an intensifier considered to be " stilted , literary , old-fashioned , high-style " , regarded as inference from german immer , or by americans labeled as " british " . instead , most speakers prefer a semantically corresponding expression consisting of conjoined syntactic reduplication : 20 . jack has become / becomes faster and faster . dictionaries and grammars of english also note this construction with the comparative ( zandvoort gives it even a name , " comparative of gradation " ) , so the expressive pattern can be regarded as quite established in english . it is not unique , though . most european languages allow the pattern comp + and + comp at least in informal register , and , i may reveal it now , these kinds of expressions are the object of study in my research on syntactic reduplication in swedish . the principally interesting thing is that languages seem to have different preferences as regards different intensifying patterns . english is perhaps most liberal in rather freely allowing conjoined repetition of type 20 , whereas koenig points out that german prefers expressions with an intensifier ( immer ) . the data i have surveyed seem to suggest that swedish is somewhere in between these two . the pattern comp + and + comp is theoretically interesting in that it expresses the same content as ever by iconicity . repetition stands for iteration and continuity ( ever , allt , sempre , yha " , cada vez ) , coordination enhances the meaning , since it implies with repetition non-simultaneity and asymmetry . even more intriguing is that some linguists ( e . g . koenig , lang ) draw a parallel between coordination and universal quantification . so we have a full circle here . as a final remark , i would like to remind that structures of the kind x + and + x are not limited to the comparative . it is quite usual to hear the use of this pattern with , for instance , verbs in colloquial speech : 21 . jack ran and ran . however , the use has not for some reason become as widely established with verbs . perhaps there is a larger resource of aspectual verbal and adverbial modifiers for verbs than the comparative , and , thus , less need for the somehow ' naive ' iterative pattern . the last assesment does not come out of the blue , but it is traditionally stated that different uses of repetitions are typical of , not only the language of poetry , but also among women and children or in texts designed for children , such as fairy tales ( note : this is merely a quote - - i would not put it in this way ! ) . what does this amount to ? reasonably , repetition is favored in discourse types where ( inter - ) personal involvement has an important role . further comments on the topic are , of course , welcome . the above summary is written in a relative haste , so i apologize for any shortcomings or misunderstandings ! the end of this message contains a list of works referred to . thank you for your interest and have a nice summer !

<subject> summary : even if </subject> dear linguists , on linguist list : vol . 8-959 ( 25 / 07 / 1997 ) , i posted the following query . three people responded to my investigation . my great thanks goes to the following people . since their judgements varied , i labelled a , b and c to them just for convenience in writing this summary . a : m . lynne roecklein < lynne @ cc . gifu-u . ac . jp > b : laura gonnerman < gonnerman @ scf . usc . edu > c : gary h . toops < toops @ twsuvm . uc . twsu . edu > the query and summary are as follows . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - i have been working on some probelms of the meanings of " even if " , especially the following so-called consequent-entailment reading of " even if " . please help me check the accptablities of the following sentences . are the following sentences acceptable or have natural flow of interpretation ? please put ok , ? or * in each slot and comments , if any . if the sentences you judge are unacceptable , what kind of context would you consider to increase the acceptabilities ? ( 1 ) ( a : * ; b : ok ; c : ? ) ( context : my employer is so puritanical that he would fire me if i behaved in what he considered a libertine manner . ) " even if " my wife smoked cigarettes , he would fire me , but , since she would n't ever smoke , he won't fire me . comment of a : the ' even if ' clause is ok with with " he . . . me " , but the second halfdoesn ' t match . no one would ever phrase this combination of ideas this way . it has a split focus . is the topic the extent of the employer 's puritanism ( first half ) , or the likelihood / unlikelihood of the speaker 's being fired ( second half ) . i find even my japanese colleagues do this split focus thing all the time . such sentences are extremely difficult and often impossible to parse in any natural way . it took several years of familiarity with japanese versions of english for me even to identify what is going on in sentences like this . i 'd love to know an effective way to explain to japanese students of english why this won't work and maybe more important , how to recognize that they ' ve pro9duced an illicit split focus construction . ( 2 ) ( a : ? ? ? ; b : ok ; c : ? ) " even if " you drink just a little , your boss will fire you , but , since you sruely won't drink at all , he won't fire you . comment of a : a ) " " even if . . . will fire you " is most easily interpreted as habitual , while " you surely * won't * drink at all " would designate a single event in the future . these sit uneasily together . b ) since drinking a lot is antithetical to drinking a little , the last clause must imply that the boss is thinking of firing the addressee for some other reason . in this case , interpeting the first half according to a ) above , there can be no connection between the firing and the drinking and the sentence fails by virtue of non-entailment . on the other hand , if one * goes back * and reinterprets the ' you ' in the first half merely as the addressee , then the sentence might be possible , given that condition b ) abvove represents the real state of affairs . it would also be implied that the boss needs just a little bit more reason to actualy execute the firing . the final clause would sound better with " can't " than with " won't " , however , in this scenario . ( 3 ) ( a : * * ; b : * ; c : * ) " even if " you drink just a little , your boss will fire you , but since you surely drink a lot , he won't fire you . comment of a : the action posited by the " even if " clause is already a maximum limit . the sentence is logically impossible . comment of b : but if you continue the sentence as below then it is fine by me . ( 3 ) ( ok ) " even if " you drink just a little , your boss will fire you , but since you surely drink a lot , he won't fire you , you ' ll get fed up and quit before he gets a chance . ( 4 ) ( a : ok ; b : ok ; c : ? ) if it doesn ' rain , the game will continue . " even if " it rains lightly , the game will continue ; but if it rains heavily , the rain will be cancelled . i ' m sorry i ' ve made a mistake here . the final clause should be , the game will be cancelled , as roecklein ( a ) pointed out . ( 5 ) ( a : * * ; b : * ; c : * ) if it does n't rain , the game will continue . " even if " it rains lightly , the game will be cancelled ; but if it rains heavily , the game will continue . comment of a : nonsense , in order and logic . comment of b : okay if you continue with something like : ( 5 ) ( ok ) if it does n't rain , the game will continue . " even if " it rains lightly , the game will be cancelled ; but if it rains heavily , the game will continue , but it will be moved to an indoor arena . ( 6 ) ( a : * * ; b : ? ; c : * ) " even if " the president were to get ingestion tonight , the cease-fire would end , but , if we resume negotiations with the enemy for a treaty of peace , it will continue . i ' m sorry i ' ve mistyped the word here too . ingestion should be indigestion . comment of a : i would imagine rather that indigestion would contribute to the end of the ceasefire . ( 7 ) ( a : ok ; b : ok ; c : ? ) " even if " my wife smoked cigarettes , i would not scold her , but , if she ever broke my favorite dishes , i would scold her . comment of a : " scold her " should nto be repeated at the end . very unnatural . ( 8 ) ( a : ? ; b : ? ; c : ? ) " even if " my wife smokes cigarettes , i will not scold her , but , if she breaks my favorite dishes , i will scold her . comment of a : underlying logic ok . i do n't like " even if " with the indicative present verb because i like to mark conditionals on the verb , but i ' m aware that this usage is in process of change . same proviso as above for the repeated " scold her . " the preferences of conditionals in even if clause over the indicative present are the same to all three people . however , i found many examples of the indicative type . this seems a matter of individual preferences . comment of b : ( 8 ) ( ok ) " even if " my wife smokes cigarettes at the dinner table , i will not scold her , but , if she breaks my favorite dishes , i will scold her . comment of c : to make sense of many of your contexts , i had to postpose the " even if " clause , e . g . , " i will not scold my wife , even if she smokes cigarettes . " placing the " even if " clause first in the sentence makes it more emphatic . my own summary : ( 3 ) and ( 5 ) are judged logically impossible as i have expected . but i do not understand laura gonnerman 's rephrasing ok sentence of ( 5 ) . ( 6 ) is also judged unnnatural to all the three people though i expected it would be ok . it seems to me the final clause cahnges the situation and focus of the sentence . why not ok ? finally , i must apologize to you all about the use of " scold " in the final two sentences . one person reminded me of the bad implication of husband 's scolding his wife . i did n't notice it . in japan , too , a husband who " scold " his wife is an arrogant person these days . thank you very much for your help . please make further comments , if any , on this usage . i ' ll be glad to make a reply . hiroaki tanaka associate professor faculty of integrated arts and sciences tokushima university , japan 1 - 1 , minamijousanjioma , tokushima , 770 , japan phone & fax : + 81 886 56 7125 e-mail : hiro-t @ ias . tokushima-u . ac . jp

" , " . . . to slowly go home . . . " and " . . . to go home slowly . . .

<subject> summary : pig latins </subject> in may , 1996 , i published a request for information on foreign pig latins . i apologize for the delay in summarizing the results . you can thank dan downs and waruno mahdi for keeping me honest and inspiring me to do this at last . i got such a great response that it was an intmidating job . forgive me ! i had n't taken the time to summarize the results until now , but here are the languages and rules that i was given . i appreciate the information ! thanks to the following contributors in totally random order : neil bermel william byrne " nadine " robert lyle good marina yaguello paul de lacy marc picard geoffrey sampson andrew s . mccullough jack aubert nevin leder scott martens billy clark jack hall judit j . toth mark a . wilson marc hamann annabel cormack nancy frishberg john goldsmith forrest richey trey jones dale russell lex olorenshaw liz mckeown marion kee salvatore attardo nobuko koyama - murakami ( which sounds like a language game already ; - ) john goldsmith , who edited the handbook of phonological theory , recommends bruce bagemihl 's survey of pig latins within that book . it was published by basil blackwell 's and reissued in paperback in 1996 . ( this is highly recommended , even by people who are not john goldsmith ! ) everyone said that these are called " language games " rather than " toy languages " , but my family is so competitive that if a game does n't have a winner and loser it 's not a game ! ( hence my use of the word " toy " ! ) here are specific examples : chinese : onsset of a typical monosyllabic word is prepended to a different rime , which is suffixed to a different onset ( possibly k ) " zhai kang " for " zhang " mandarin : fanquie languages ( each example has its own name , based on the pattern involved ; no example given ) dutch : backward speaking : reverse syllables and sometimes words ( emerged from economic causes - - needed secret speech so other fisherman would n't learn their secrets ) english : insert / ab / between onset and rime of each syllable " maby nabame abis babill " for " my name is bill " . ( also with / ^ b / , called " ubby dubby " ; sample at very end ) gibberish : insert " itherg " after each consonant " bithergy thitherga witherrgay " for " by the way " bicycle : insert @ s ( schwa s ) after every consonant : " h @ se t @ sold m @ sse " for " he told me " eggegg langeggwagegg : add ' egg ' after every consonant : " theganksegg yeggou " for " thank you " zambuda : english pronounced wrong in every possible way ! long vowels became short ; c pronounced s when should have been k . " @ - nosk beh-faw - re een-tee - rynj " for " knock before entering " yardle bardle : those particular words were interspersed in such a way that the victim - - er , eavesdropper - - could never figure out the rules . ob-talk , from the firesign theatre : " ob " before words ( breaks down into raucous imitation of rooster calls at a cockfight ) arp-bark : put / arp / before " first vowel of every syllable " ( and i thought there was only one vowel per syllable anyway ) " harpellarpo " for " hello " french : verlan : individual words are said backwwords . " verlan " for " l ' enverse " ( meaning " backwords " " zomblou " for " blouson " ( jacket ) german : " lav " inserted after vowels . " ilavich wohlavonelave ilavin balavad holavombulavurg " for " ich wohne in bad hombburg " hungarian : put " v " after the vowel and repeat the vowel : " tu - vudsz i-vigy be-ve - sze ' - ve ' - lni ' vi " for " tudsz igy besze ' lni " more advanced : say / rg / isntead of / v / . italian : " latino maccheronico " - not the same thing . uses italian roots and attaches latin inflection morphology for humorous effect . italian language game : subsstitute initial consonant with " f " " fatino faccheronic " for " latino maccheronico " japanese : ba - bi-bu - be-bo language : insert " b " plus vowel between syllables " waba taba sibi waba " for " watasi-wa " portuguese : sima language : insert " sima " [ after vowels , i think ] " quecima-rosima cocima-mesima ( or cocima-mercima ) alcima-gocima ) for " quero comer algo " linga do pe : ( language of the letter p ) here 's how one version of it works : 1 . add [ p ] to the end of each syllable . 2 . after the [ p ] you just added to the syllable , copy the rime of that syllable . ( rime = nucleus plus coda ) . 3 . change open syllables in closed [ o ] and [ e ] to the open vowels [ o ] and [ e ] , respectively . 4 . disregard the stress patterns of the original word / sentence ; instead , stress the * copy * of each rime . example : voce ^ cortou o seu cabelo ? did you cut your hair ? vopo ' - cepe ' corpor ' - toupou ' opo ' seupeu ' capa ' - bepe ' - lopo ' ? another person sent this example : " quepe-ropo copo-mepe alpo-gopo " for " quero comer algo " russian : fufajskij yazyk : place " fu " before every syllable in a word : " fuprifuyet " for " privet " porosyachia latin ( pig latin ) : can be formed different ways . military pig latin : " ka " instead of " fu " : " katy kakukada kaseikachas kaikadiosh " for " ty kuda sejchas idiosh " spanish : insert [ vf ] between onset and rime of each syllable , where [ v ] is the vowel of the rime : " mefe llafamofo bifill " for " me llamo bill " insert / po / to the end of each syllable : " copomopo espotaspo " for " como estas " yakut : " pig latin " - - imitation of " russian pig latin " ( no examples given ) thanks again to everyone for your contributions and interest . i ' ll eagerly accept further contributions at my new address : markell8 @ aolcom yubbu gubbuys ubbar grubbate ! ubay hubope yubbu uball hubbav ubba gubbood subbumubber !

<subject> huron </subject> i am doing research about indigenous languages for a writer at the banff centre . he is looking for a specific article but can only provide me with the following information : he knows that the huron language is considered an endangered language . but , he has been informed by a linguist friend of an article written about an elderly man living in the detroit area who learned this language as a boy from his grand-mother in the 1920 's . this man does not wish to speak with people or take inquiries . however , an article was written about him and his experiences . there was hope that this article was printed in _ orion nature quarterly _ magazine sometime in 1995 . the editor was contacted , but has not yet responded . without a complete citation , i cannot request a copy of this article , if one was written on this subject . does anyone have any information on this topic or this specific article ? i would really appreciate any information that you can provide or point me to . there is however a rush on this request . i would appreciate any information by july 31 , 1997 . thank you very much , nadia mazzuca - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - email : nadia _ mazzuca @ banffcentre . ab . ca the banff centre library banff , ab canada
<subject> expletive neg0 and opacity effects </subject> dear all , in the absence of n-words , italian marks sentential negation by ` non ' alone . opacity effects are created by ` non ' in the sense that a wh-operator cannot be extracted from a position below neg0 to , say , a higher speccp position . this effect is attributed within relativized minimality to the necessarily co-occuring non-overt operator in specnegp . the operator counts as a closer potential a ' - antecedent and prevents the moves wh-constituent from properly governing its trace . so far , so good . in french , ` ne ' ( = neg0 ) is not usually able to mark sentential negation on its own . in some contexts , however , it can , e . g . , with pseudo-modal verbs such as ` oser ' , ` pouvoir ' . interestingly , in such contexts , the same opacity effects are also produced , suggesting the presence of a non-overt operator in specnegp . so far , still so good . french ` ne ' also has expletive uses . for example , in the complement of adversative predicates and comparatives , ` ne ' can appear in formal styles without reversing polarity . in such contexts , opacity effects are not attested , suggesting that no non-overt operator occupies specnegp . what i 'd like to know is what the situation is in other languages , e . g . , spanish , catalan , and relevant non - romance varieties too . i think i ' m right in saying that , in these varieties in which the neg0 is normally sufficient to mark sentential negation alone , the neg0 morpheme ( e . g . , no ) also has expletive uses . the question is this : does expletive neg0 produce opacity effects in these languages or not ? relevant information about specific languages would be welcome , as would references to discussion in the literature . many thanks . paul dr paul rowlett head of french department of modern languages university of salford salford m5 4wt greater manchester united kingdom

<subject> sum : quantification </subject> about four weeks ago , in linguist 8 . 948 , i asked a question on behalf of the basque language academy 's grammar commission about the standard or recommended scope of " quantifier " and " quantification " as grammatical terms , with special reference to the function of " so many " and " so " in sentences like : there were so many students that we needed a larger classroom . the students were so intelligent that we needed to get another teacher . i wished to know whether it is considered terminologically appropriate to say that not only " many " and " so many " but also " very " and " so " quantify , and thus that the function of all of these ( including what i call degree modifiers ) is quantification . better to contextualize the terminological problem that motivated the question in the first place and to help clarify the following report / discussion , let me suggest , ad hoc , calling the two positions contemplated the " quantifiers versus degree modifiers " position and the " quantifiers subsuming degree modifiers " position respectively ; or for short , the versus position and the subsuming position . it is also only honest for me to declare at this point that my personal position has always been and continues to be that of the versus view , although i tried to word the original question neutrally . at this point i perhaps ought to note that several respondents seem to prefer to treat " so many ( students ) " and " so ( intelligent ) " as merely various occurrences of a single item " so " rather than treating _ so many _ as an " item " to be discussed in its own right . i view this as a manifestation of linguistic anglocentrism : unlike english , in many languages " so many " is not expressed by the item equivalent to english " so " plus a quantifier equivalent to english " many " , and since i was not particularly asking about english in my question , i reject the assumption that the english lexical composition of " so many " is of crucial relevance to the issue i raised . thanks to the following who responded to my question : bruce d . despain , patricia galea , e . h . klein - v . d . laaken , jan k . lindstrom , p . l . peterson and marilyn n . silva . a summary of their answers and suggestions follows , with an interjection of my own personal opinion at times , identified by my initials ark . marilyn silva supports the versus position , stating that " quantifiers determine noun phrases , not adjectives . " for " very " and " so " she prefers the term " intensifier " to my proposed " degree modifier " . patricia galea expresses the same views . ( [ ark : ] since my original question was not about the latter terms , i shall refrain from defending my preference of " degree modifier " over " intensifier " in this context ; larry trask 's _ dictionary of grammatical terms in linguistics _ treats the two terms as interchangeble . ) marilyn silva also discussed what i called " consecutive " sentences , pointing out that the subordinate clauses in the two english examples cited above , " . . . that we needed a larger classroom " and " . . . that we needed to get another teacher " , are called " adverbial clauses of extent " in her treatment of english grammar , _ grammar in many voices _ ( ntc pub . group , 1995 ) . she considers that here " it is the clause that seems to quantify , not the intensifier in the main clause " . silva went on to point out that english clauses of extent can be licensed by a main clause containing _ so _ ( with or without _ many _ ) , as above , but also by one containing _ such _ , as in : george was such a gentleman that he never raised his voice . and draws our attention to the fact that _ such _ could hardly be called a quantifier . ( [ ark : ] this argument seems to be of general typological interest , independently of the fact that there is no real equivalent of this use of _ such _ in basque . ) in all these sentences with extent clauses , silva argues , " it is the [ subordinate ] clause that seems to quantify , not the intensifier in the main clause . . . which merely licenses the subordinate clause . " according to silva , then , _ so _ and _ such _ should not be lumped together with items like _ many _ or _ very _ in any case , in line with the view that they do not themselves quantify but merely license a subordinate clause which quantifies . looking beyond english , jan lindstrom pointed out that in swedish a single lexical item , _ mycket _ , functions both as a quantifier ( of nouns ) meaning " much " and as a degree modifier or intensifier of adjectives meaning " very " , providing the following examples : 1 ) da " r fanns mycket folk . ' there was much people ' 2 ) hon a " r mycket intelligent . ' she is very intelligent ' lindstrom does not seem to be defending a particular terminological usage in providing this observation , but merely wishes to offer useful information that may be of interest in the discussion . [ ark : ] it seems to me that while the interest of this sort of observation is undeniable , it does not obviate the need for a terminological distinction , nor does it justify the subsumes position , but rather illustrates the need for linguists to employ a clear meta-language to enable us to distinguish between items or uses even where , as here , their formal expressions overlap language-specifically . ( by the way , some other instances of the use of a single form for " very " and " much " include portuguese _ muito _ , catalan _ molt _ , and italian _ molto _ ; but i can think of many more languages that do not show this kind of overlap or homonymy . ) philip peterson wrote discussing in somewhat more abstract terms the actual semantics of terms like " many " and " more " , and referred me to his article " complexly fractionated syllogistic quantifiers " ( journal of philosophical logic , 1991 , 20 , 287-313 ) . bruce despain 's comments are oriented to language-specific issues of syntactic classification of quantifiers in english that are not likely to be relevant to a description of basque , for which reason i shall not report his suggestions here . henny klein brought to my attention the following bibliographical reference : gary , e . ( 1979 ) extent in english . a unified account of degree and quantity . phd thesis , university of california , los angeles . in summary , none of those who responded favoured the subsuming position according to which " very " and " so " can be referred to as quantifiers or their function as quantification ( unless that was what jan lindstrom wished to imply ; it is my understanding that it was not ) . four of the six answers do not actually lean one way or the other . the two answers that address my question directly and suggest an answer , those of silva and galea , both constitute votes for the versus position . eskerrik asko denoi ( many thanks to all ) alan r . king , ph . d . alanking @ bigfoot . com alternative email addresses : mccay @ redestb . es , a @ eirelink . com , 70244 . 1674 @ compuserve . com snail : orkolaga plaza 3 1a , 20800 zarautz , basque country , spain phone : + 34-43 - 134125 / fax : + 34-43 - 130396 visit my web page at - - > http : / / www . eirelink . com / alanking /

<subject> summary : vowel deletion between two like consonants </subject> quite some time ago , i wrote requesting information concerning instances of proper names where the pronunciation reflects a deletion of a vowel occuring between two like consonants in the spelling of the name . i cited such names as farrer [ fer ] worcester [ wust ^ r ] and leicester [ lest ^ r ] and had hoped to find a whole slew of other names exhibiting this phenomenon . unfortunately , i got no responses which dealt with proper nouns . however , i did get some interesting responses discussing how this occurs in hungarian , arabic , and english outside the realm of proper nouns . thanks to all who responded . sorry i did n't post sooner . it 's just that i had hoped to get something on proper nouns before replying . sincerely , david harris david harris david @ las-inc . com language analysis systems voice : ( 703 ) 834-6200 ext . 242 2214 rock hill road , suite 201 fax : ( 703 ) 834-6230 herndon , va 22070 original query : > i ' ve been thinking about names like worcester , leicester , and > gloucester which , though perhaps viewed by most of my fellow americans > as strange relics of british eccentricity , really do follow a simple > and straightforward phonological process where two like consonantal > continuants separated by a weak vowel ( in this case schwa ) are merged > into one by the deletion of this weak vowel . the same phenomenon > occurs with the name of a school in provo , utah which i attended as an > adolescent : > > farrer junior high school > this is pronounced " fair " ( or " ferr " if your accent makes a > difference between [ er ] and [ eir ] which mine does n't ) > > anyway , using a regular expression , i searched the 1990 us census > list of 80 , 000 surnames available on the web in order to find names > in which like consonants were separated by one vowel and came across > a few more from various language groups that may or may not be > examples of this .

<subject> re : 8 . 1107 , qs : lang . games , " democratic , " word change </subject> dear mr . ungar : is us congress incorrect ? any noun can modify another noun . but the heart of your question is that employment of democratic makes most people associate feelings deriving from the political process : democratic elections , etc . most republicans would hardly utter an unfavorable word about " democracy " though its origins are hardly as uncontroversial . democrat calls forth associations with figures in the democratic party , many of whom are personally unlikable or do not enjoy reputations for integrity or ethics . so the republican strategy is actually quite clever . particularly in view of the fact that the republic party would call forth the same positive associations since our electorate is blissfully unaware of the significant differences between the two forms of government . the democrats used to try to do something similar with " party of nixon " , " party of hoover " but since educational decline in this country , how many high school graduates know who hoover or nixon were ? it is a dilemma for propagandists ! pat

<subject> anglicization of composers ' names </subject> judging from the return post , i must have sounded like some kind of self-proclaimed expert on composers ' names . let me hasten to say that i ' m not . all the pronunciations i put in that little list came as surprises to me . in all cases but one , they were given to me by native speakers of the composers ' language , while i was visiting the composers ' native country . i do n't speak any of those languages and certainly do not claim any expertise . i ' ve just been trusting " competent native speakers " . the one exception , by the way , was when karl haas , on one of his daily " adventures in good music " broadcasts , asserted that pachelbel should be pronounced pach - el - bel . based on karl 's provenance i was inclined to trust him . but perhaps i ' ve gone overboard taking natives ' pronunciations as gospel . after all , we americans certainly manage to mangle enough of our own words , do n't we ? sorry for any consternation i may have caused . i ' ve certainly gotten an education from this . cheers , gordon brown

<subject> forwarded : ucla jobs / temporary ( 97-98 ) </subject> ucla jobs / temporary ( 97-98 ) priority normal the ucla department of linguistics expects to have several short-term jobs available teaching various courses in the coming academic year ( 1997-98 ) . most of the positions are in the area of syntax , though we will hire in other areas too . these are all replacement positions , for faculty who are on leave , and there is no realistic prospect of any of them developing into permanent positions . some of the courses that need to be taught are undergraduate classes , while others are graduate classes . at least three , and possibly as many as five courses will involve syntax courses at various levels , ranging from introductory undergraduate syntactic analysis to advanced graduate seminars . our most pressing need in these areas is during the fall and winter quarters ( see below for an outline of quarter dates ) . in addition , we may need an instructor for two lower-division introductory courses in general linguistics in the winter and / or spring quarters ; one of these is a generic intro to linguistics ; the other is a course surveying the languages spoken in the usa , including immigrant languages , american indian languages , and dialects of english and spanish , covering phonetics , history , and sociolinguistic issues , among others . finally , we will have openings for advanced graduate courses in some of the subfields represented in our department - - such as phonology , phonetics , psycholinguistics , computational ling . , syntax , semantics , specific language areas ( such as african , american indian , etc . ) for these advanced graduate courses , we are primarily interested in hiring relatively senior people with established reputations ( e . g . people who are on leave and who are interested in visiting ucla ) , though more junior applicants will also be considered . because we have a large number of courses available for visitors to teach next year , we are quite flexible in terms of the type and level of appointments . in particular , we may be interested in hiring some people for single-course lectureships ( paying in the neighborhood of $ 7 , 000 to $ 10 , 000 per 10 - week course , depending on seniority ) ; we may also consider full-time appointments for periods of one or two terms , with a courseload of 2 courses per term , and pay levels per course roughly comparable to those mentioned above . finally , we may make appointments with less than full-time teaching loads ( e . g . teaching one course and co-teaching another ) . these visiting positions are not restricted as to rank . we are especially interested in hiring faculty from other universities who plan to be on leave during ( part of ) the coming academic year and who may be interested in visiting our department for part of the year and teaching a course ( or two ) while they are here . each course runs for ten weeks ( with two 2 - hour lectures per week ) followed by an exam week . applicants should send a letter of application , including a cv , a statement of previous teaching experience , as well as the names , addresses , and phone numbers of three recommenders to : tim stowell ( chair ) , department of linguistics , ucla , los angeles , ca 90095-1543 . ( actual letters of recommendation should not be sent at this time ; likewise candidates should not send voluminous dossiers of publications , etc . ) applications for fall quarter courses should be received by aug . 15 1997 , and applications for winter and spring quarter courses should be received by sept . 10 1997 , though late applications will also be considered as long as the positions remain unfilled . potential applicants are strongly encouraged to inform us by e-mail , as soon as possible , of their intention to apply for these positions . initial enquiries by email may be directed to tim stowell ( stowell @ ucla . edu ) or to anna meyer ( meyer @ humnet . ucla . edu ) . ucla is an equal opportunity employer . - - - - - - - - - - tim stowell chair , ucla department of linguistics 405 hilgard ave . los angeles , ca 90095-1543 usa phone : 1-310 - 825-0634 fax : 1-310 - 206-5743 e - mail : stowell @ ucla . edu
<subject> question on a word - reply </subject> many thanks for the replies ! in particular , i ' ll pass on the reference suggestions . i should probably be slightly more specific about what we ' re looking for : a word ( again , my friend writing the dissertation believes one exists ) that would fit in the sentence : " word x has / is [ xxxx ] with the normal usage of word y . " or else : " these people have [ xxxx ] the meanings of word x and word y . " that is , we ' re not looking for examples of x and y , or for a description of the general phenomenon of x changing meaning or having a special ( argot or jargon ) meaning , but we want to know if there is a term [ xxxx ] which would accurately indicate that x and y are being used synonymously when they are not normally synonyms . . . the specific x and y in question here are " marriage " and " home " ( yes , i do realize that " marriage " and " home " overlap a lot in their usage anyway ; i ' m not familiar enough with my friend 's topic to know exactly what she 's arguing , but i believe it involves a particular couple 's development of an individual and idiosyncratic concept of marriage , which at times becomes , um , blended ? with their concept of home to the extent that they will use either word to refer to it . . . something like that . regardless , you can tell from my attempt to state the question why a word is needed . . . : - ) replies by email please ( i ' m not a regular reader of these lists ) . and thanks again . jonathan gilbert jong @ dragonsys . com > > > peter t . daniels < grammatim @ worldnet . att . net > 07 / 29 / 97 06 : 45pm > > > an example would help , but it sounds like you ' re talking about jargon , slang , or argot ( idiosyncratic language varieties defined according to the user group ; see textbooks of sociolinguistics ) . > > > deborah d k ruuskanen < druuskan @ cc . helsinki . fi > 07 / 30 / 97 12 : 00am > > > words used in separate contexts changing meaning ? i should imagine there are quite a lot , particular if you think of american / british differences .

<subject> thanks to our subscribers </subject> dear linguist list : the time has come for us to once more send out a general mailing , but this missive is much more fun to compose than a call for funds . instead , we thank all those who recently contributed to the maintenance and expansion of the list . because of your generous donations we have been able to hire several new student editors . elaine halleck , marty jacobsen , brett churchill , julie smith , and anita huang will take care of the ever-expanding functions associated with the linguist network . two private donors in particular must be thanked , since linguist 's fund increased by $ 8000 through their signal efforts . linguist and linguistics are in their debt ; by meeting our funding goals , we can continue to grow and better serve the linguistics community . in addition to offering more services to more people , linguist will soon provide * better * service due to the support of the linguistics data consortium . ldc came to our rescue this spring by donating a new sun ultra mainframe computer . this machine will shortly be hosting our email lists , solving the posting problems we all suffered through earlier this year . the consortium also must be sincerely thanked . to conclude , linguist again thanks all of you who responded to our last call for funds , and those who have donated in previous drives . your contributions have provided and will continue to provide the linguistics community with a forum essential to the discipline . we ' ve listed contributors to date below . 1997 contributors valued supporters ( $ 50 and under ) anonymous galina alexandrova lloyd anderson ( ecological linguistics ) paula baird robert beard mayrine bentley cassian braconnier joaquim brandao de carvalho carsten breul deborah brownstein claudia brugman r . joe campbell linda coleman anthony davis dorothy disterheft jean - louis duchet suzette haden elgin david eddington feride erku dominique estival susan felshin luisanna fodde robert fouser louanna furbee judith fuller elly van gelderen keith goeringer claire gronemeyer alan harris fritz heberlein suzanne hilgendorf caitlin hines david holt alice horning elizabeth hughes bernhard hurch frances ingemann martha islas elaine jones marion kee andrew kehler suzanne kemmer jong - mi kim carolyn kirkpatrick micael kliffer john koontz knud lambrecht young - h lee judith levi joan levinson vern lindblad virginia locastro fernando martinez - gil ana maria martins bart mathias madeline m . maxwell scott mcginnis sue medeiros anita mittwoch simon musgrave michael newman lynn nichols richard oehrle fernando ordonez susan pintzuk terence potter burton rosner lynn santelmann mary schleppegrell andreas schramm klaus schubert carol myers scotton antonio r . m . simoes jim sneddon susan steele roland sussex jan - olof svantesson robert l . trammell u . of michigan linguistics dept . jeff von munkwitz - smith barbara vance joerg wagner kathleen m . ward frank wijnen patrons ( $ 50 or more ) : anonymous anders ahlqvist belinda bicknell & gary witus wayles brown claudia brugman cascadilla press donna christian billy clark bernard comrie hortensia curell mary dalrymple douglas l . dee stanley dubinsky dept . of linguistics , university of durham william edmondson dan everett julia falk joseph foster donald freeman nancy frishberg kazuhiko fukushima richard hudson barbara herrarte michael hess roderick jacobs dora johnson ioanna kappa hans kronning indiana university press linguistique africaine ( via cassian braconnier ) ernest mccarus jerry mcmenamin geoff nathan barbara pearson ingo plag linda stump rashidi robert ratcliffe ann reboul recherches linguistiques de vincennes lisa reed nikolaus ritt charles scott carlota smith ute smit university of maine linguistics dept . max wheeler ronnie wilbur mainstays ( $ 100 or more ) : graeme forbes vicki fromkin bruce fraser monica macaulay & joseph salmons marguerite mackenzie johanna nichols sergio scalise chi - lin shih and richard sproat frances trix blackwells publishing center for applied linguistics cornell university press csli garland publishing holland academic graphics indiana university linguistics club john benjamins publishing , north america kluwers publishing linguistic society of america the lucent foundation ( via chilin shih and richard sproat ) media enterprise michigan state university , linguistics dept . mit press mitwpl ( mit working papers in linguistics ) montclair university , dept . of linguistics ndt media oxford university press routledge summer institute of linguistics university of north texas , division of linguistics university of connecticut , linguistics club mouton de gruyter
<subject> qs : a question from ask - a-linguist </subject> hi there ! i am sure you all know about the marvelous service that " ask - a-linguist " offers to the public . we received the following request on july 14 and until last night , there was no answer to it :
<subject> computational linguistics : the altavista " refine " option </subject> a colleague of mine told me about the " refine " option offered by the altavista search engine ( http : / / www . altavista . digital . com / ) and how good it was . in a nutshell , the " refine " options returns a list of synonyms of , and notions related to the words in your query . indeed , it gave extremely sensible responses . perversely perhaps , i tried it in french , using " vin " ( what else ! ) as the keyword . bingo . this is what it returned : 72 % etait , etre , annees , meme , apres , etaient , derniers 59 % egalement , particulierement , differentes , possibilite 52 % qualite , vins , vin , vignoble , vigne , crus , vignes , vignerons , vigneron [ etc . . . ] far from satisfactory . " eau " and " pain " returned similar nonsense , featuring " etaient " , " etre " , " egalement " et alia in prominent positions . in fact , altavista " refine " seems decidedly adverse to foodstuff in french , " fruit " , " poisson " and " sandwich " failing equally miserably ( so did " sable " , " mer " , " lac " ) . so i was quite surprised when italian queries about " wine " returned sensible synonyms : 60 % vino , vini , vigneti , uve 40 % quantita , ettari , vitigni 39 % sapore , profumo , invecchiamento [ etc . ] " acqua " and " pane " fared equally well . so i turned my attention to spanish . spanish did quite as badly as french . this is quite puzzling for the size of the spanish data is quite large . i do n't know what inspired me , i decided to ask for an italian sandwich ( " panino " ) . bingo again ! 60 % perche , chissa , guardo , cazzo , sembrava , poiche , merda , riposto [ yes , unbelievable but true ] 54 % mangiare , specialta , birra , mangia , roba , piatti , gusti , soldi , bere 33 % avevo , scusa , aveva , stavo , rispose , facevano [ etc . ] my colleague and i scratched our collective heads , experimented some more , and came to the conclusion that the thesauri are built by a neural net ( she is heavily into neural nets ) . still , the excellent behaviour of the english thesaurus was suspect . but no , experimenting demonstrated that it could not have been a hand-crafted thesaurus . there are ways of " salting " a neural net and that is probably what digital did for english ( and perhaps for italian ) . do take a break and experiment a bit with altavista " refine " option in your favourite languages ( polish was as nonsensical as french ) . it is quite amusing . and perhaps useful : next time someone knocks at your door with a neural net for sale . . . ( i have seen queries for " kentucky fried chicken " return " chicken sexers " , " waste burners " and " singing teachers " , courtesy of a neural net ) . j . guy @ trl . telsta . com . au

<subject> sum : ocr software </subject> a couple of weeks back i posted a query about ocr software for the mac that is trainable enough to be useful to a linguist scanning latin or ipa - based non - english texts . thanks to jakob dempsey sarah rilling michael betsch andrew arefiev marc fryd and daniel loehr for their responses . in the mac world , it appears that the front-runner in this area is the widely-available omnipage programme from caere corporation ( http : / / www . caere . com for info ) . it is apparently trainable although one respondent expressed some doubts about being able to train it to handle more than a single special font . i should also mention that the first sales rep i talked to previously about omnipage seemed to think that it might have trouble with the combinations of letters and diacrits typical of ipa - based alphabets . however , the publicity literature on the web site seems to imply that it can be trained to recognize combinations of separate characters and the last sales rep i talked to seemed to think that there was no doubt that omnipage could do the job . jakob dempsey also mentioned an " expensive kurzweil product " for the mac , but i have n't heard anything further about this . i also got two responses that mentioned windows - based applications that are highly trainable . one is a german product called optopus made by a german company called makrolog in wiesbaden which is " exclusively trainable " - - that is , it needs to be trained from scratch and so can be configured to any alphabet you like . the other is by a russian company called bit software ( www . bitsoft . ru ) ; their programme is called finereader and in addition to having a wide range of set alphabets for langauges using both latin and cyrillic , they report having sucessfully trained it to recognize icelandic and tibetan fonts ) . david beck = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = david beck department of linguistics sixth floor , robarts library 130 st . george st . university of toronto toronto , ontario m5s 3h1 canada e-mail : dbeck @ chass . utoronto . ca phone : ( 416 ) 978-4029 ( 416 ) 923-2394 ( home ) fax : ( 416 ) 971-2688

one of these is a generic intro to linguistics ; the other is a course surveying the languages spoken in the usa , including immigrant languages , american indian languages , and dialects of english and spanish , covering phonetics , history , and sociolinguistic issues , among others . finally , we will have openings for advanced graduate courses in some of the subfields represented in our department - - such as phonology , phon-etics , psycholinguistics , computational ling . , syntax , semantics , specific language areas ( such as african , american indian , etc . ) for these advanced graduate courses , we are primarily interested in hiring relatively senior people with established repu-tations ( e . g . people who are on leave and who are interested in visiting ucla ) , though more junior applicants will also be considered . because we have a large number of courses available for visitors to teach next year , we are quite flexible in terms of the type and level of appointments . in particular , we may be interested in hiring some people for single-course lectureships ( paying in the neighborhood of $ 7 , 000 to $ 10 , 000 per 10 - week course , depending on seniority ) ; we may also consider full-time appointments for periods of one or two terms , with a courseload of 2 courses per term , and pay levels per course roughly comparable to those mentioned above . finally , we may make appointments with less than full-time teaching loads ( e . g . teaching one course and co-teaching another ) . these visiting positions are not restricted as to rank . we are especially interested in hiring faculty from other universities who plan to be on leave during ( part of ) the coming academic year and who may be interested in visiting our department for part of the year and teaching a course ( or two ) while they are here . each course runs for ten weeks ( with two 2 - hour lectures per week ) followed by an exam week . appli - cants should send a letter of application , including a cv , a statement of previous teaching experience , as well as the names , addresses , and phone numbers of three recommenders to : tim stowell ( chair ) , dept . of linguistics , ucla , los angeles , ca 90095-1543 . ( actual letters of recommendation should not be sent at this time ; likewise candidates should not send voluminous dossiers of publications , etc . ) applications for fall quarter courses should be received by aug . 15 1997 , and applications for winter and spring quarter courses should be received by sept . 10 1997 , though late applications will also be considered as long as the positions remain unfilled . potential applicants are strongly encouraged to inform us by e-mail , as soon as possible , of their intention to apply for these positions . initial inquiries by email may be directed to tim stowell ( stowell @ ucla . edu ) or to anna meyer ( meyer @ humnet . ucla . edu ) . eoe . = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = fyi ( " for your information " ) / / cheers , ach = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = > > > > > > alan c . harris , ph . d . telnos : main off : 818-677 - 2853 professor , communication / linguistics direct off : 818-677 - 2874 speech communication department california state university , northridge home : 818-366 - 3165 spch csun fax : 818-677 - 2663 northridge , ca 91330-8257 internet email : alan . harris @ csun . edu www homepage : http : / / www . csun . edu / ~ vcspc005 = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =

<subject> evolvable hardware and gp </subject> paper now available in post script . . . " rapidly reconfigurable field-programmable gate arrays for accelerating fitness evaluation in genetic programming " a late-breaking papers from gp-97 conference . abstract : the dominant component of the computational burden of solving non-trivial problems with evolutionary algorithms is the task of measuring the fitness of each individual in each generation of the evolving population . the advent of rapidly reconfigurable field-programmable gate arrays ( fpgas ) and the idea of evolvable hardware opens the possiblity of embodying each individual of the evolving population into hardware for the purpose of accelerating the time-consuming fitness evaluation task this paper demonstrates how the massive parallelism of the rapidly reconfigurable xilinx xc6216 fpga can be exploited to accelerate the computationally burdensome fitness evaluation task of genetic programming . the work was done on virtual computing corporation 's low-cost hots expansion board for pc type computers . a 16 - step 7 - sorter was evolved that has two fewer steps than the sorting network described in the 1962 o'connor and nelson patent on sorting networks and that has the same number of steps as the minimal 7 - sorter that was devised by floyd and knuth subsequent to the patent . john r . koza forrest h bennett iii jeffrey l . hutchings stephen l . bade martin a . keane david andre published in koza , john r .

- - - - - - - - the prolamat conference is an internationally well known event for demonstrating and evaluating activities and progress in the field of discrete manufacturing . sponsored by the international federation for information processing ( ifip ) , the prolamat is traditionally held every three years and it includes the whole area of advanced software technology for design and manufacturing in discrete manufacturing . past conferences have explored : - manufacturing technology , - advances in cad / cam , - software for discrete manufacturing , - software for manufacturing . the eight international prolamat focused on the theme of man in cim . the 1995 prolamat featured the theme of life cycle modelling for innovative products and processes . the 1998 conference in italy will be organized by the university of trento , school of engineeering and department of computer and managemet sciences , jointly with istituto trentino di cultura , under the auspices of the wg2 for " computer - aided design " and wg3 for " computer - aided manufacturing " of the technical committee 5 for " computer applications in technology " . this conference will be the last prolamat before the next century , and it provides an opportunity to investigate and imagine what the digital communications revolution going on all around us will mean for manufacturing . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ conference subjects -

- - - - - - representations , reuse people , not machines , design new products and make manufacturing systems work . increasingly , groups of people are required to design new products and bring them to market . requirements for agility and the suitability of specific manufacturing processes must be matched with the culture and knowledge base of the work force . world - class processes have floundered when this was not done . information and communication systems can either amplify or reduce the magnitude of differences across culture or engineering discipline . researchers specializing in knowledge representation , modelling , communications , standardization , and reuse will be invited to share their experiences and research perspectives . - enterprise data sharing across engineering , cultural , and supply chain boundaries , - distributed manufacturing and supply chain management - early stage product development which dynamically incorporates supplier constraints - standard models for component information representation , product and process interchange , - technologies for knowledge sharing , collaboration , and across the product lifecycle , - adaptive systems for organizational management , knowledge sharing , education , and training - organizational and manufacturing process simulation - organizing and representing design and manufacturing process for dissemination and reuse - the interface between human and machine for information sharing , training , education , -

<subject> toc for linguist list </subject> dear sirs , prof . helen dry has offered that we might include announcements of our activities in linguist ( message of 24 april 97 ) . you will find the announcement of a workshop on reported speech below . thank you in advance . manfred roncador announcement of a workshop at the ' 20th conference of the german linguistic society ( dgfs ) ' in halle on ' form and function of reported speech ' coordinators : tom gueldemann and manfred von roncador linguistic studies have increasingly demonstrated that in contrast to the traditional approach a clear-cut distinction between direct and indirect speech is for many languages untenable . the existence of such intermediate forms as semi-direct speech , so-called style indirect libre ( free indirect discourse ) , and logophoric constructions point rather to an analysis whereby the different forms of reported speech are assigned a specific position on a continuum whose extreme poles are characterized by a minimal or maximal shift of the deictic centre ( cf . roncador 1988 ) . in the framework of such a theoretical approach , it is interesting to investigate which different functions the individual forms of reported speech may serve in discourse . another interesting question concerns the grammatical characteristics of quotative constructions ( qc ) , i . e . linguistic expressions used in languages to signal reported speech , and how these qcs are related to the functions of the different categories of reported speech laid out on the continuum mentioned just above . possible features to be investigated in this respect are inter alia the internal structure of qcs , the obligatoriness of the individual propositional elements in them ( such as reference to speaker and addressee ) , the particular strategy for expressing the locutionary aspect , and the nature of the semanto-syntactic relation between qc and the quote itself . the historical processes that qcs or their elements are subject to constitute another possible focus of attention . this is meant to include the discussion on grammaticalization processes in this domain , which is already quite extensive but which has probably focused too much on the development of speech verbs only . as analyses of reported speech in single languages are often still oriented towards concepts developed for european languages , contributions on non - european languages offering new insights on less-known aspects of this functional domain will be particularly welcome . this will serve to put these first attempts to typologize the phenomenon of reported speech in its functional and formal aspects ( cf . roeck 1994 ) on a broader empirical basis . references : roeck , m . de . 1994 . typology of speech reports . in : engberg - pedersen et al .

<subject> british vs . american < a > ( s </subject> griffin bacal internet mail direct inquiries to postmaster @ gbinc . com 8 / 7 / 97 2 : 36 pm british vs . american < a > ( summary ) i received a number of very helpful and insightful replies in response to my question about differences in british & american pronunciations of < a > ( / ae / vs . / a / in foreign and loan words such as france , pasta , nicaragua , et al . ) and thought it might be nice to pass them on to the list . typically , there 's a nice mix of agreement & disagreement among the responses , esp . on the issue of whether americans are more " loyal " to the source languages than britons are . there are also some observations on british changes to native stress patterns ( which i myself noticed while dining out with british colleagues who order " creme bru - lee " for dessert . . . ) . one question that no one 's answered yet , though : in the british english pronunciation of " jacques chirac " , why does " jacques " have something like / a / when " chirac " has / ae / ? ( the non - french stress on the first syllable of " chirac " has been explained to me already ! ) anyway , here are the responses i received . thanks again to all . david weiss david _ weiss @ gbinc . com - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - ( 1 ) i ' ve noticed also that the british are more likely to anglicize , in the sense of using english pronunciations , especially of vowels . perhaps this habit comes from their lengthy use of latin , as a learned language . in the middle ages , i believe it was common to adapt latin to the language of the host country . for example , long a in latin was generally said as a post vowel shift / e : / or / ej / in england , as it still is . whereas in north america we generally use the classical pronunciation , with the low vowel . the other instance you cite / frans / vs . / fraens / , is a more recent development in british speech , in which / ae / lowered to / a : / before certain consonants , although not invariably . for example , in laugh , half , castle , fasten , plant , aunt the lower vowel prevails in standard british english . at least this is what i seem to have noticed . how about you ? is it possible that pasta was borrowed into british english after the vowel lowering took place ? that might explain the lack of lowering in this instance . also , the lowering does not seem to be entirely phonologically conditioned , e . g . , ant / aent / vs . aunt / a : nt / . " pants " may not be british , but i do n't believe this vowel is lowered , either : possibly a new borrowing from american english ? dr . ronald cosper ronald . cosper @ stmarys . ca - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - ( 2 ) david , just a quick response to your article in the linguist list . i ' m not british or american , but have had a fair amount of exposure to both accents of english . it seems to me that the situation is n't very conclusive . many british speakers believe that they retain the right to ' naturalise ' or ' anglicise ' foreign words names , but then so do americans . the problems is that they have done this differently . if we look at more recent french borrowings , the british have generally naturalised them in terms of their stress pattern ( therefore : garage , ballet , beret , buffet , massage , to follow the pattern of older borrowings like village , damage ) , whereas americans keep it more foreign sounding by stressing the second syllable . in some cases , in the uk , ' garage ' can rhyme with ' carriage ' , and ' buffet ' with ' ( little miss ) muffet ' . on the other hand , older brits still reserve the right to pronounce ' trait ' with the final < t > silent , as in french , unlike americans ; and as you mentioned , there 's ' france ' ( and ' chance ' , 'd ance ' ) . however , if we think of non - european names like iran or pakistan , one stereotype of american pronunciation is eye - ran and pack-is - stan . moving on to your / a : / v . / ae / distinction that you mentioned , i think some of it will have to do with the fact that in american the < a > in < man > is almost universally pronounced / ae / , with perhaps the exception of southerners . in the uk , on the other hand , it is / ae / mainly in the south . when you move to northern england , or wales or to scotland , the sound is / a / , i . e . close to the european sounds as in german ' mann ' . ( and here , the / a : / in ' path ' or ' car ' is also close to [ a ] . ) you also get this over in northern ireland and the republic . therefore , a southern english speaker would be used to ' naturalising ' an item said using a scots , northern , etc . accent ( thus [ man ] - - > [ maen ] ) , and would therefore apply the same ' rule ' to european names . peter tan elltankw @ nus . sg - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - ( 3 ) hi , i am writing back to you off net because i have nothing really substantive to add to your observation , except to say it is n't just names - listen to the british pronunciation of ' lasagna ' or ' pasta ' as well with [ ae ] . but what i wanted to say is that i named the process " mangle " as a new phonological rule of [ a ] > [ ae ] / [ + foreign ] , or even , more widely , take any foreign word and pronounce it somehow other than the way those foreigners would pronounce it ( you see why i am not replying to the whole net : - ) ) . i noticed it in the speech of my father-in - law , from leeds , whom i love dearly and who insists on saying [ paest @ ] for ' pasta ' . i would never correct him , but i ' ve been aware of it since , and six months of living in britain a couple of years ago only confirmed the observation you have noted as well . i ' m looking forward to seeing what other , more serious , responses look like . margaret e . winters mew1 @ siu . edu - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - ( 4 ) the general rule in british english is to make stressed / a / in foreign words into / ae / , as we have in the u . s . in ' piano ' . but ' france ' does n't follow the pattern , because it was anglicized so long ago , and follows another general pattern of south english dialects that is only a couple of centuries old at most : turn historical short a ( low front / ae / ) into / a : / before ( certain ? ) fricatives , with or without a nasal in between . hence ' bath ' , ' castle ' , ' fast ' , ' lance ' , ' last ' , ' france ' , etc . all have / a : / in the south of england . northerners kept the / ae / pronunciation , as did americans outside the boston area . the word ' bath ' is a good shibboleth for northerners vs . southerners in england . i think i recall reading in some history-of - english text that / ae / - - > / a : / is not a cut and dried rule ( or an exceptionless change - - however you want to think of it ) . and i can't recall exactly how the rule was stated - - perhaps the fricative had to be in a cluster . note that words ending in - ash did not undergo the change . and i ' m not sure how the lengthening of / a / before - r and - l relates to this change - - ' arse ' and ' half ' got / a : / and and then lost their liquids , in both north and south england , but not in america outside boston . try pyles and algeo 's history of english if you want to know more about this particular change . - suzanne kemmer kemmer @ ruf . rice . edu - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - ( 5 ) mr . weiss : i ' m not entirely sure that ' non - english < a > ' is the relevant parameter . i ' ve recently returned from the southwest , where a number of people pronounce ' colorado ' with < ae > ( a pronunciation some national news announcers reporting on the recent colorado floods also use ) . as a native of southern new england , i had always heard this word pronounced systematically and exclusively with < a > , by americans , perhaps , as you suggest , because of its spanish origin . but my recent experience shows that my pronunciation is clearly * not * the only one available . the same variation also occurs in the american pronunciations of ' vietnam ' , with some using < a > , as i do , and others using < ae > . ' native ' english words also participate in the same phenomenon : in addition to ' aunt ' , which is a well-known example , there are words such as ' bath ' , ' path ' , and ' laugh ' , which are often pronounced with < a > , not < ae > , in parts of new england . for these last four words , my native pronunciation is < ae > , although i find myself sometimes using < a > in ' aunt ' , perhaps under the influence of ' worcesterese ' . . . george aubin gaubin @ eve . assumption . edu - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - ( 6 ) it seems to me that the sound represented by < a > in most european languages lies between the english [ a ] as in father and [ ae ] as in pan . the brits tend to slide it forward when pronouncing words such as padre , while the americans tend to slide it back ( except for those great lakes speakers who have shifted / a / towards the center ; they do n't shift it at all ) . in either case they are assimilating the nonexistent phone into their own phonological system . i do n't think either is more ' loyal . ' a similar phenomenon happens with the french rounded high front vowel in ' tu , ' but with speakers of different languages . english speakers , when they do n't get it right , tend to make it a high rounded back vowel [ u ] . spanish speakers tend to pronounce it as a high unrounded front vowel [ i ] . the reason why may be related to subtle shifts in location of native vowels , or customs in teaching l2s or both . michael newman mn24 @ is6 . nyu . edu - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - ( 7 ) hi david . your query on linguist list about foreign ( a ) pronunciation was passed on to me by mark liberman . as he indicated in his response to you , i have just completed a phd dissertation on this subject . the central phenomenon under study was the one you noticed : the difference between american and british treatment of foreign ( a ) . the pattern you observed is indeed the main pattern of divergence between the dialects : americans tend to use the / a : / of ' father ' in words like ' pasta ' and ' mazda ' while brits tend to use the / ae / of ' fat ' . the american usage is really akin to using the / o / of ' pot ' , since for most americans outside of new england / o / and / a : / are merged ( father and bother rhyme ) . the divergence between the dialects is concentrated predominantly in closed ( or potentially closed ) syllables . in open ( or potentially open ) syllables , both dialects use / a : / : americans and brits alike pronounce ' llama , bravado , nirvana ' , etc . , with / a : / . a very good article by geoff lindsey ( 1990 ) , in a volume edited by s . ramsaran called studies in the pronunciation of english , shows that the am - br difference extends to other vowels and reflects a basic difference in the organization of am and br vowel systems : am vowels contrast along a tense-lax dimension and br along a long-short dimension . charles boberg < cboberg @ unagi . cis . upenn . edu > - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - ( 8 ) i just had a discussion of this with larry trask , an american - born vasconist working in england ( u . sussex , i think ) . ( cced ; hi , larry . ) based on that discussion , i think i can codify the phenomenon you describe . 1 . the british " nativize " foreign words much more aggressively than the americans . a couple of examples that are unrelated to the [ a ] / [ ae ] issue : " don juan " sp . [ don ' xwan ] , am . [ dan ' wan ] , but br . [ dan 'd zu &n ] ; " don quixote " sp . [ don ki ' xo te ] , am . [ dan ki ' ho ti ] , but br . [ dan ' kwik sot ] . 2 . as a relatively recent innovation ( 1700 's , i think ) , in the south of england an original [ ae ] is backed to [ a ] in some syllables whose coda contains a fricative . hence " grass " , am . and n . eng . [ graes ] , s . eng . [ gras ] ; other examples are " past " , " dance " , " entrancing " , " chaff " , " rather " . this explains [ frans ] ; it 's not an anomalous attempt to retain a foreign [ a ] , it 's a purely southern english [ a ] , exactly as you would expect from an original [ ae ] . 3 . " pasta " is anomalous . from the above account i would expect s . eng . [ past& ] ; are you telling me they say [ paest& ] ? larry ? 4 . when the syllable in question gets farther from the end of the morpheme , things get murky . for " rascal " , both [ ras kl ] and [ raes kl ] sound plausibly londony to me . but what about " vasconist " ? try as i might , i can't imagine anyone , be he ever so eton - and - oxford , saying [ ' vas k& nist ] ; i can only hear [ ' vaes . . . ] . in the foregoing , i have blurred the distinction between the low-mid [ a ] and the low back english vowel that i think looks a little like a " d " in ipa . true oxonians nearly gag every time they say " rather " . allan wechsler awechsle @ bbn . com - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - ( 9 ) dear david , nice question : the reason is actually differing vowel systems between us and uk . the back / a / of us that you use in words like " milan " does not exist over here : the closest is the vowel you hear in france , which is / a : / ( back ) . this vowel either occurs 1 ) as a result of the loss of rhoticity ( car , cart ) , or 2 ) ( in rp and southern english ) before voiceless fricatives ( bath ) or clusters starting with a nasal , ( dance , france : the similar vowel to the french from is therefore co-incidence ) . in the case of 2 ) this is a change ( 17 / 18th century ? ) from the front / ae / . to pronounce milan with this way would make it sound like it was spelt " milarn " . an exception to this is some speakers ' pronunciation of pakistan with 2 / a : / s . i ' m a northerner , so use / ae / in bath , france and the words like pakistan ( and iraq , iran , ( woops , but not in zimbabwe ) : may be many of us use / a : / as these have entered the language since the vowel has been available ? ) regards , maik gibson maik @ azariah . org . uk

<subject> british < a > </subject> having followed the discussion of [ ae ] vs . [ a : ] , etc . in s british english , i 'd like to add a few historical points that may help to straighten out some uncertainties . 1 . me / a / remained open [ a ] in s england until about the middle of the 17th century ( the first good witness to [ ae ] is john wallis ' grammar of 1653 ) . at this stage there was no lengthening or change of quality . 2 . the new [ ae ] began to lengthen before / r / in the later 17th century ( categorically ) , and then before voiceless fricatives except [ s ] , and variably before / nc / clusters . the first traces of the lengthening ( well described in christopher cooper 's grammatica linguae anglicanae , 1685 ) show lengthening as variable , more frequent if a consonant follows the consonant causing lengthening : thus short vowel in car , long in cart , short in pass , long in passed , etc . 3 . lengthening increases during the 17th - early 18th century , and by around the 1740s ( e . g . in mather flint 's prononciation de la language angloise , 1740 ) there is variable lowering of the lengthened [ ae : ] to [ a : ] , partly lexically determined . this continues throughout the 18th c . 4 . the situation - - which words have lengthened and / or lowered vowels - - continues to be fluid well into the 19th c . a j ellis in 1874 reports both the modern pattern and a whole set of variants , including short vowels even before / r / . 5 . the retraction to a low central or back ( ish ) vowel is late , probably not before the later 1870s . 6 . the process never diffused through the whole lexicon except before / r / ( which of course was later lost ) ; there are still loads of minimal or near-minimal pairs in rp and other southern varieties , e . g . ass / arse , cant / can't , mass / mask , etc . a lot of forms vacillate , e . g . short or long in masturbate , plastic , etc .

<subject> grepping summary </subject> thanks to all who responded to my request for grepping under a dos environment with the following syntax : < grep - r < fn1 > < fn2 > fn3 > < where fn1 is the file with the set of strings to be grepped > < fn2 is the data-base > < fn3 is the output . > with the suggestions and help that i have got , i have literally " grepped " all about grep . thanks a lot i got a whole lot of answers which i am summarising below : 1 . the first was to use perl script to write my own grep : for both unix and dos , perl is a language that will easily allow to create a small program that will do what you ask . more information about perl , including free downloads for many environments , can be gotten from the perl language home page , http : / / www . perl . com / perl / index . html . 2 . the second suggestion was similar in nature : use awk and lex tools for the job . 3 . under unix environment three types of grep were proposed : a . egrep egrep - f fn1 fn2 > fn3 where fn1 is a file containing the search patterns ( one per line ) . if you only want to search for literal strings ( no special characters ) then you can use fgrep instead of egrep . do ' man grep ' for more details , b . fgrep fgrep - f patt-file - name < database-to - search > results-file will work , assuming patt-file - name is a file of _ strings _ ( regular expressions containing metacharacters are not allowed by fgrep . ) say man fgrep to get the details . one hitch however it will only match strings , not regular expressions . c . sgrep the sgrep utility ( not standard unix ) permits complex ( and nested ) patterns to be searched for . 4 . under dos the gnu tools are now available under dos ; gnu has only one grep and lets you do this ( according to the manual ) with grep - f f1 f2 > f3 this works and i have used it with success . thanks to andreas mengel incidentally egrep , sgrep and fgrep versions for dos exist and can be found at : ftp . rediris . es / mirror / simtelnet / gnu / gnuish / grep15 . zip thanks to susana sotelo docio 5 . another suggestion was to use sed sed - n - f < file > permits many patterns to be searched for ( with some problems when multiple matches occur on a line . 6 . another solution under dos was to grep for a large number of strings at once in a ` regular expression ' . a second alternative was to batch-file the operation , which i am using at present as a solution , but wanted something more functional . 7 . a commercial solution was also proposed : mks ( mortice - kern ) in canada makes a commercial set of unix apps and commands for use in dos and windows environments , including ksh , awk , grep , gres . their grep syntax is : grep - f pattfile file > output _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ many thanks to : martin wynne < eiamjw @ comp . lancs . ac . uk > will dowling < willd @ spectranet . ca > kevin bretonnel cohen < kevin @ cmhcsys . com > mark liberman < myl @ unagi . cis . upenn . edu > john e . koontz koontz @ boulder . nist . gov peter hamer < p . g . hamer @ nortel . co . uk > stuart luppescu < s-luppescu @ uchicago . edu > stephen p spackman < stephen @ softguard . com > d . lee < d . lee @ lancaster . ac . uk > chris culy < cculy @ blue . weeg . uiowa . edu > david palmer < palmer @ linus . mitre . org > shravan vasishth < vasishth @ ling . ohio-state . edu > susana sotelo doc ' io " < fesdocio @ usc . es > andreas mengel < mengel @ babylon . kgw . tu-berlin . de > for their prompt and helpful replies to my query .

<subject> summary : double - dutch and youthese / pig latin </subject> my original query was posted on jul 12 1997 in linguist ( re : 8 . 1048 ) and asked for data on : ( a ) secret signalization codes among children approaching ( but still not having fully reached ) the age of adolescence , particularly so-called " double - dutch " ( a more or less invariant standard syllable is inserted into every word to render it unrecognizable ) in various languages of the world ; ( b ) exclusivist , but not particularly secretive youth-specific slang , so-called " youthese " , among teenagers ( adolescents ) , functioning as peer , in-group , or clique trademark . i have received a great deal of very useful information . i have not attempted making a summary earlier , because new responses kept coming in ( i suppose , i chose an inopportune time to send in my query , when most people are on vacation / holidays ) . having now also recieved the material one respondent said she would send me after returning from a journey , i can now proceed with the summary : the responses also included new leads to further search , and the following is a total summary . i first of all want to thank all the responders and contributors for their bery helpful and informative messages : jannis k . androutsopoulos < androuts @ novell1 . gs . uni-heidelberg . de > jack aubert < jaubert @ cpcug . org > rick mc callister < rmccalli @ muw . edu > bill fisher < william . fisher @ nist . gov > tim jake gluckman < tjgluckman @ aol . com > jack hall < jhall @ uh . edu > marion kee < marion _ kee @ cs . cmu . edu > nobuko koyama - murakami < koyamamu @ hawaii . edu > nathan sanders < sanders @ ling . ucsc . edu > nik taylor < jnataylor @ pcola . gulf . net > markell r west < markell @ afterlife . ncsc . mil > mark a . wilson < maw @ annap . infi . net > sorry if i missed somebody ( 1 ) first , the direct respondents to my original query : - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - rick mc callister : called my attention to the fact , the pig latin was the term more commonly used for what i called " double dutch " , and also gave me the url of his www spanish pig latin page : http : / / www . muw . edu / ~ rmccalli / spigpayatinlay . html the www page is very informative . it also suggested a new venue of search , which proved quite fruitful , i . e . i started to search the internet for mentionings of " pig latin " , see ( 2 ) below . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - bill fisher : one good example of this , which you may already be aware of , is " boontling " , a jargon that was developed in the 19th century in marin county , california . i ' ve got a pretty decent book on it , " boontling , an american lingo " , by charles c . adams , u . of texas press , austin , 1971 , isbn 0-292 - 70082 - 2 . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - tim gluckman : when i was at school in the ' 60s - in stockport , england - i recall that oneschoolgirl clique in my year spoke one of these insider languages . one day i asked one - they were all in my schoolyear - of the more ansprechbar of these recently pubertied schulmaedchen what they were saying . as far as i can recall it , her explanation was that their geheimsprache included a variable substitution of t / d - perhaps other consonants too - before the end of the word . it certainly had the affect of of rendering their conversations incomprehensible . this is the only time i ever came across it ; c . 1964 / 5 . they spoke it for 6 months as far as i can recall . whether it went on beyond that i do n't know ; these girls were in the middle of three streams at the grammar school 15 kilometres south of manchester where i went to at that time . and on a question of mine indicated , they were at an age where they were actively dating with boys . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - marion kee : there was a discussion on linguist ( i think sometime in 1995 ) about pig latin and related topics ; i think there were examples cited from a number of different languages . the discussion might have included a list of references . to find it in the linguist archive , try searching on " pig latin " and / or " egg latin " ( in egg latin , every syllable gets the syllable " egg " added prior to its vowel ; e . g . , " eggegg leggateggin " - - " egg latin " . english only , as far as i know , and my ex-husband learned it when he was 10 or 11 , in athens , ohio , usa . ) this suggestion too opened a fruitful venue for further search , see ( 3 ) below . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - nik taylor : my cousins , my brother , and i had a code called flip-top . you started out by flipping around pairs of letters , double letters being counted as one , and adding - ot to consonants and nothing to vowels , doubles being indicated by " squared " , so " hello " - " e hot o lot-squared " . she and her friend had invented it as " tot " ( i think that was its name ) , and it was just adding - ot to consonants and the " squared " part , so " hello " - " hote lot-squared o " , i added the flipping part . ( 2 ) rick mc callister 's www page suggested a search for other such pages , but i only found one , that of nathan sanders : http : / / ling . ucsc . edu / ~ sanders / research . html which also was very informative on language games , referred to as _ ludlings _ , but i wrote the owner and got further information : - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - nathan sanders : a good place to start would be the work of bruce bagemihl , who has done a lot of work in the area of ludlings / language-games . here are two references on ludlings . the first has a large list of examples , while the second has more explanation of the ludling phenomenon itself : bagemihl , bruce . 1989 . ` ` the crossing constraint and backwards languages .

" e l ' envers " means " backwards " and if you pronounce l ' envers with its syllables reversed you get " verlan . " this is definitely an example of what you described as type b - - adolescent exclusivist . i have heard it said that verlan originally was used by thieves and pickpockets , but suspect this is just a made-up explanation with no particular basis in fact . but whatever its origins , it is now used by adolescents as an exclusivist slang . i do n't think any body actually uses verlan for full sentences or extended conversations . it mostly forms the basis for individual slang words that go into normal sentances . you could refer to your zon-mai ( maison ) or zon-blou ( blou son ) . there was a movie a few years ago called " les ripoux " which is verlan for " les pourris " which in context referred to corrupt cops . i think the term for french - born arabs , " beurs " was formed using some version of verlan which is not always regular . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - jack hall : in my response to the query about pig latin , i mentioned what i called the " op " language , which i read about in a book or magazine when i was about 10-12 years old ( mid 1950 's ) . as i recall , the simple rule was : put " op " ( phonetically [ a : p ] after every consonant in a word except the last ( final ) consonant . i am not certain what the rule was about consonant clusters . thus " dog " would be " dopog " . i remember specifically that the word " umbrella " was given as : " umopbopropellopa " , indicating that " op " is to be placed after all three consonants at the beginning ( umbr - - ) , but only one after the double " l " . i have never met anybody who has heard of this language , or knew how to use it , and , since i learned about it from a book , rather than from other people ( children ) , i cannot say anything about the sociolinguistics of it . for me it is an idiolect ( ! ! ) we ' re talking at least 40 years here , but the strange thing is , i can actually visualize the item that i read , and the page on which it was printed , although i certainly do n't know the title of the book . i am sure that it was written for people my ( our ) age at the time , not for adults . i remember that , even while i was reading it , and although i was only about 10 years old , i was aware that the description of the " language " was not sufficiently detailed in treatment of matters such as consonant clusters or sequences . i ' m pretty sure that " st " would be treated as a cluster , with one " op " inserted after it , not an " op " after the " s " and another " op " inserted after the " t " . thus " stay " would be " stopay " , not " soptopay " , but i remember that at the time i was aware that i was not sure how such a word would be treated . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - nobuko koyama - murakami : japanese ba-bi - bu-be - bo language ( or lingo ) was used by teenagers . ba - bi-bu - be-bo language was specifically used when they . . . . . . . were teasing or joking with others , wishing to make their conversation sound so secretive , and purposely annoying others . manipulating this language so skillfully was a key to the membership of this group . if you mimicked this language poorly , you would be automatically excluded from the group . one more thing : there were some variants in use of this language . differences seemed to be strongly related with types of dialects ( of japanese ) they spoke . in the northern part of the mainland japan , ba-bi - bu-be - bo was inserted accordingly based on phonetics . in the tokyo metropolitan areas , ba-bi - bu-be - bo was inserted between orthographic letters ( at least such was a tendency that i had found ) . e . g . , " icecream " ( written as a-i - su-ku - ri - : - mu ) nb " : " represents lengthening mark in japanese orthography here . 1 ) a-ba - i-bi - su-bu - ku-bu - ri-bi - i-bi - mu-bu ( tokyo ) 2 ) a-ba - i-bi - su-bu - ku-bu - ri-bi - i-mu - bu as far as i know , the age group that i mentioned ( those were teenagers in 80 's ) were in the rage of 15-18 ( which means that they were in high school at that time period : nb in japan , unlike u . s . , high school is legally and clearly a separate institute ) . we all encountered and experienced this ba-bi - bu-be - bo language when we were high school students . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - mark wilson : it 's been several years since i observed the phenomenon i told markel about ( the german insertion of " lav " after vowels ) . german : " lav " inserted after vowels . " ilavich wohlavonelave ilavin balavad holavombulavurg " for " ich wohne in bad homburg " to be more precise , the insertion was " lavv " , where v stands for the vowel immediately preceding the ( inserted ) " l " . = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3 some tentative conclusions : ( a ) both phenomena , pig latin - type phonologically manipulated secret language , and youth slang , are apparently neither an anglosaxon , nor a european particularity . ( b ) predeliction to pig latin - type language game covers a much wider age bracket than i had initially suspected , beginning at around 10 years , and overlapping with youth slang , in which pig latin - type expressions may be taken up as slang - specific words . thanks again to everybody who contributed . perhaps i should apologize that this summary got so long , but to be honest , of course , i am very happy to have gotten so much to summarize , and thought it would be selfish not to share it with fellow linguist - listers and future searchers of the linguist archives . for this same reason , here are my own experiences with pig latin : at age 12-13 years , in indonesian junior middle school ( smp ) in bogor , west java , i encountered ( took part ) in the following form of pig latin : sentences were constructed to preferentially consist of bisyllabic words ( most basic words in indonesian are bisyllabic ) , and when the first syllable ended in a consonant , the entire second syllable was replaced by _ se _ ( _ e _ as in english " were " ) , otherwise the initial consonant of the second syllable was retained and only the rest replaced : _ saya cinta sama kamu _ " i love you " ( _ c _ as engl . _ ch _ ) became : _ sayse cinse samse kamse _ from other people i know that similar indonesian pig latins had existed in other parts of indonesia , particularly in central and east java . most of the ones i heard of had the _ se _ insertion , but the rules were not always exactly like in bogor in my childhood . it was only used occasionally , particularly to tease those who were not " in " to the secret . it was a passing fad which lasted not even as long as one school year . finally , i understand that some time around 10 years ago , in israelian pop-music there had been a hit , which also became popular outside israel , particularly in west europe . the title seems to have meant " i love you " in pig latin - style manipulated hebrew . can anyone tell me anything of that song , but particularly of the hebrew pig latin ? does anyone know anything about pig latin e . g . in chinese , hindi , tamil , arabic , turkish , or suaheli ? does youth slang exist in amerindian languages , in australian aborigine , or other languages of pre-industrial communities ? best regards to all , waruno - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - waruno mahdi tel : + 49 30 8413-5301 faradayweg 4 - 6 fax : + 49 30 8413-3155 14195 berlin email : mahdi @ fhi-berlin . mpg . de germany www : http : / / w3 . rz-berlin . mpg . de / ~ wm / - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

<subject> re : 8 . 1205 , disc : british < a > </subject> peter tan wrote : it seems to me that the evidence for ' aggressive ' nativisation / anglicisation in southern british english as opposed to american english is not clear . in my last lengthy message i did not react to this issue . my reaction is that i agree with peter . i do n't know if some of the unclarity has to do with different historical periods which differentiate british and american english , or different cultural domains , e . g . , music ( e . g . , italian terms like stacatto and the others i mentioned in the last message ) vs . foods ( e . g . , pasta - - and more recently a bunch of mexican foods , e . g . , taco , tamale , etc etc ) - - or both etc etc . however , reversals of the ' agressive ' southern brit expectation include some of the commonest and widely known foods , such as " tomato " and " banana " where undoubtedly the southern brit " back a " pronunciation is closer to the source than the american pronunciation ( lengthened and raised " tomato " as in " day " and " mate " ) and " banana " rhyming in american english with " anna " which has " front a " , not " back a " as in the " continental " european pronunciation of the same name . " tomato " , of course , is perhaps the earliest " mexican " food to become a widespread word in english . as for jim fiedelholz 's observation on brit " nicaragyua " , also striking is brit ( and canadian ) " bilingyual " . at least " bilingyual " could be considered conservative if it is modelled on the french pronunciation with a front labio-velar " w " , as in " figyure " ( for those of you who do n't pronounce it as " figger " ) . - - benji

<subject> resources on afrikaans </subject> a student of mine here in japan wishes to examine the evolution of afrikaans and its relationship to dutch / german / english . source material is scarce in local libraries , and i personally have not much knowledge of the language or literature on it . both diachronic and synchronic studies would be of interest - overview and broadly drawn material would be preferable to highly technical ( e . g . , syntactic ) analysis . thank you in advance to helpful linguists who can take the time to point us beyond " the development of afrikaans " and " a grammar of afrikaans " and work by botha to further material . reply privately to guy modica < gmodica @ fh . seikei . ac . jp > .
<subject> apocryphal american structuralist assertions </subject> there are two common , apocryphal assertions identified with american structuralist linguistics , and i am wondering if either of these assertions was actually made by an american structuralist . they are : 1 . language structures vary in infinitely many ways . this statement has been associated with boas , but it 's not in the hail intro . this statement has also been associated with martin joos , who supposedly said something along those lines attributing this view to boas ( but not necessarily endorsing it himself ) . 2 . the distributional method , applied rigorously , would yield a distinct syntactic category for every word in a language . it is possible that z s harris made such an assertion , though i have n't seen mention of it in the secondary literature . i am particularly interested in some form of these assertions made by structuralists who believed it themselves ; but if such do not exist , i am interested in attribution of these two beliefs to structuralists by others . thanks , bill croft

<subject> call for papers : post - communist language change </subject> call for papers the russian language and area studies program at texas tech university announces a conference on " society , language , and culture in post - communist russia , the other former republics of the soviet union , and eastern europe . " the demise of communism in the soviet union and eastern europe has ushered in a mass of changes in nearly every aspect of the lives of the people in these nations . there have been changes not only in the political system , but also in the way the people of these nations lead their everyday lives and perceive their place in the world . the fall of communism has altered the way the people in former communist countries work , shop , rest , travel , etc . these changes in day-to - day life combined with the removal of state control over literature and the press have affected the way the people of these nations write and the way they read . profound differences in language , style , and content can be found in the works of leading literary figures and in the pages of any newspaper . similar changes have taken place in other spheres of art and life . how do the people of former communist countries deal with decades of a communist cultural legacy ? do they attempt to return to their pre-communist heritage , hoping to adapt these older cultural values to a modern world ? how do these nations deal with the deluge of social , material and cultural imports from their long-time capitalist foes ? how do they cope with the collision of traditional , communist and mass culture and to what degree are elements of each present in their culture today ? the conference will be held april 2 - 4 , 1998 at texas tech university . depending upon our resources we hope to downlink the conference to other sites around the nation . we also hope to publish a volume of selected papers from the conference . papers and panels from all disciplines and areas are welcome . the deadline for proposals is jan . 15 , 1998 . please address proposals on language to erin collopy , proposals on literature to anthony qualin , and proposals on society , politics , or culture to lewis tracy at : classical and modern languages and literatures texas tech university lubbock , texas 70409-2071 proposals will also be accepted by e-mail at : prof . collopy ( language ) : pveri @ ttacs . ttu . edu prof . qualin ( literature ) : pvton @ ttacs . ttu . edu prof . tracy ( society , politics , or culture ) : pvlew @ ttacs . ttu . edu erin collopy visiting assistant professor department of classical & modern languages & literature texas tech university lubbock , tx 79409 ( 806 ) 742-3286 pveri @ ttacs . ttu . edu

<subject> subcategorization in tranformational grammar </subject> dear colleagues , i ' m wondering if someone could give me some pointers to the latest literature in transformational grammar ( gb , p&p , minimalism ) that deals with issues of subcategorization . in particular i would like to get a sense of the latest thinking , including ways in which minimalism departs from previous assumptions . among the questions that i would ideally like to see addressed are the following : - what kind of subcategorization relations have been assumed in the recent literature , and for what kinds of phenomena ? for instance , a transitive verb must somehow encode the requirement of taking a dp complement . but can a verb also take a pp complement according to the identity of that pp 's head ( as in _ rely _ + _ on _ ) ? - how are subcategorization relations constrained ? that is , what syntactic ( or semantic ) properties are thought to be accessible ( in the limit ) to the selecting head ? - if there are substantive formal constraints on subcategorization , where do they come from ? is there anything in the architecture of the theory from which such constraints would follow ? thanks very much , - - andreas kathol

" while such a wording sounds rather modest , the actual implementation in his book , if viewed within the framework of his time , might very appropriately be called revolutionary . he broke with august schleicher 's distinction between 'd evelopment ' ( in prehistorical time ) and 'd ecay ' ( in historical time ) in the history of language and replaced it with his notion of continuous , uninterrupted development . his survey of the relevant literature of his time is almost exhaustive , and his findings serve as the solid stepping stone for his own advances . to facilitate reading , the editor has supplied an index of names ( with life dates ) , a complete listing of the literature referred to by scherer as well as an introduction to scherer 's life and his general scholarly achievements . towards a history of the basque language jose ignacio hualde , joseba a . lakarra & r . l . trask ( eds . ) 1995 365 pp . current issues in linguistic theory , 131 us / canada : cloth : 1 55619 585 0 price : us $ 90 . 00 rest of world : cloth : 90 272 3634 8 price : hfl . 150 , - - john benjamins publishing web site : http : / / www . benjamins . com for further information via e-mail : service @ benjamins . com questions related to the origin and history of the basque language spark considerable interest , since it is the only surviving pre - indo - european language in western europe . however , until now , there was no readily available source in english providing answers to these questions or giving an overview of past and current research in this area . this book is intended to partly fill this void . the book contains both state-of - the-art papers which summarize our knowledge about particular areas of basque historical linguistics , and articles presenting new hypotheses and points of view based on hard evidence and careful analysis . all contributors to this volume have demonstrated expertise in the topic within basque historical linguistics that their chapter addresses . two classical articles by the late luis michelena are included in english translation . in addition , the book includes studies on diachronic phonology , morphology and syntax . the relation of basque to other languages is also investigated in a couple of chapters . english historical linguistics 1994 . papers from the 8th international conference on english historical linguistics ( 8 icehl , edinburgh , 19-23 september 1994 ) 1996 viii , 403 pp . current issues in linguistic theory , 135 us / canada : cloth : 1 55619 590 7 price : us $ 84 . 00 rest of the world : cloth : 90 272 3639 9 price : hfl . 150 , - - john benjamins publishing web site : http : / / www . benjamins . com for further information via e-mail : service @ benjamins . com this volume offers a selection of 19 papers from those read at the 8th international conference on english historical linguistics . the topics discussed span the whole history of english from the common germanic period to the present century . the book also includes , as appropriate to the conference venue , a number of papers on the aspects of the historical development of scots and scottish english . historical pragmatics . pragmatic developments in the history of english andreas h . jucker ( ed . ) 1995 xvi , 624 pp . pragmatics & beyond new series , 35 us / canada : cloth : 1 55619 328 9 price : us $ 97 . 00 rest of the world : cloth : 90 272 5047 2 price : hfl . 170 , - - john benjamins publishing web site : http : / / www . benjamins . com for further information via e-mail : service @ benjamins . com until very recently , pragmatics has been restricted to the analysis of contemporary spoken language while historical linguistics has studied historical texts and language change in a decontextualized way . this has now radically changed and scholars from around the world are trying to build a new theoretical framework that integrates recent advances both in pragmatics and in historical linguistics . this volume , which contains 22 original titles , starts with an introduction that is both a state-of - the-art account of historical pragmatics and a programmatic statement of its future potential and its different subfields . part i contains seven pragmaphilological papers that deal with historical texts and their interpretations by paying close attention to the communicative context of these texts . the second and third parts comprise papers in diachronic pragmatics . the ten papers of part ii take a linguistic form as their starting point , e . g . particular lexical items or syntactic constructions , and study their pragmatic functions at different times ( diachronic form-to - function mappings ) , while the four papers of part iii take a particular pragmatic function as their starting point . e . g . discourse strategies or politeness , and study their linguistic realisation at different times ( diachronic function-to - form mappings ) . contributions by : c . allen ;

<subject> two summaries </subject> i apologize for being so negligent in posting these summaries to questions i asked 6 weeks ago . the responses were plentiful and very useful , and quick ! congratulations go to james vanden bosch ( vand @ calvin . edu ) and rob pensalfini ( rjpensal @ mit . edu ) who answered my questions on french loan words and language evolution before i had even received the posting from linguistlist . wow . the figure i had remembered was that some 10 , 000 words were borrowed from french into english . as most people said , it comes from baugh , albert c . ( 1951 ) , _ a history of the eng lang _ , 2nd edn . routledge & kegan paul , london , p . 215 . which was basically the only place i had n't looked . other interesting information : p . 327 " according to jespersen , nearly half ( 42 . 7 percent ) of the french borrowing in english to ca . 1900 belong to this [ 1250-1400 ] period . 36 . > from thomas pyles , the origins and development of the english language . ny : harcourt brace jovanovich 1971 , 2nd ed . pyles is quoting ( his footnote 36 ) : jesperson , growth and structure of the english language , 9th ed . oxford 1954 ( orig . pub . 1905 ) . other references : coleman , julie ( 1995 ) the chronology of french and latin loan words in english . _ transactions of the philological society _ 93 , 95-124 . there are further references there . there 's also a recent book , i think , by christiane dalton - puffer . steve seegmiller wrote : the total number of borrowings from french is certainly much higher that 10 , 000 - probably ten times that number or more , if you count the word in an unabridged dictionary ( rather than , say , the 20 , 000 most common words ) . i have heard figures ( perhaps from jespersen again , i ' m not sure ) to the effect that 80 % of all of the words in are borrowings , and 80 % of those are from french and latin . > from terry nadasdi i just saw your posting on linguist . i do n't have an exact reference , just a suggestion of where you might consider looking . i just had a look at my m . a . thesis which was on english loan words in canadian french . i have a quote there which suggests that w . d . whitney might be a place you could look . the quote is as follows : " rarely has any cultivated tongue , during a like period of history given up more of its ancient material than did the english during the few centuries which succeeded the norman invasion . . . " this quote by whitney was taken from a . elliot , 1889 in an article entitled " speech mixture in french canada " , american journal of philology , vol . x , 2 " speech mixture in french canada " , american journal of philology , vol . x , 2 no . 38 . p . 158-186 . i unfortunately no longer have the article with me , but your library should have it in order that you might find the original whitney source which give actual numbers of loan words from french to english . thanks again to ( in no particular order ) : roslyn blyn - ladrew ( jladrew @ chesco . com ) david denison ( mfcepdd @ fs1 . art . man . ac . uk ) steve seegmiller ( seegmillerm @ alpha . montclair . edu ) terry nadasdi ( tnadasdi @ gpu . srv . ualberta . ca ) burns cooper ( ffgbc @ aurora . alaska . edu ) w . h . edmondson ( w . h . edmondson @ cs . bham . ac . uk ) terry lynn irons ( t . irons @ morehead-st . edu ) ( and anyone else i missed ) this was my original second posting about the evolution of languages : > i once read that the natural evolution of a language is from > analytic to synthetic . i ' ve been unable to find that assertion > since , and am wondering if i made it up . replies to this open question were much more varied and i ' ll quote them all . > from rob pensalfini ( rjpensal @ mit . edu ) : i can't comment on who might have said it , but it has probably been said . i think english serves as a counterexample to some degree , where you had a highly inflecting language that lost a lot of its inflection ( verbal and nominal ) and now uses prepositions et al where case marking would have once done the work . i always imagined it as a circle , so that a fully isolating language might start to incorporate certain things and over the centuries become synthetic , polysynthetic even ( incorporating not only adpositions but pronominal arguments ) . eventually , some of the distinctions encoded in the inflection might be lost , some of the inflection might be lost altogether , and then the language ( we ' re talking centuries later again ) might use independent words ( perhaps adverbials or something ) to indicate particular grammatical relations , and lo and behold you ' ve got an isolating language again . the fact that change in either direction is possible is why there are two sides to debates on things like what the ancestor australian language ( s ) might have looked like . australia has both head marking ( polysynthetic ) languages and dependent ( case - ) marking languages , as well as languages that are a mixture of the two . some people think that the original language was dependent marking and that truncation and cliticisation of pronouns led to head-marking ( ken hale and i are among these people ) , while other people take the equally valid view that the ancestor was synthetic and that case marking developed in conjunction with the loss of head marking . hope this was of some use , rob carl mills ( carl . mills @ uc . edu ) wrote : i do n't know who made up this " theory , " but they are probably wrong . on this view , what happened to english between ca . 800 and ca . 1500 ? ? > from peter daniels ( pdaniels @ press-gopher . uchicago . edu ) : there are some remarks on this in the new book by anatole lyovin , * introduction to the languages of the world * ( oxford , 1997 ) ; i do n't remember whether he gives references . but the notion of progress between types is certainly found in max muller . i believe it was folks like boas who laid it to rest ; meanwhile the romance future formation cycle had been noticed , and if high - class languages like latin and french could oscillate between analytic and synthetic , then obviously it could n't be an evolutionary sequence ! > from john halloran ( seagoat @ pop . primenet . com ) : a trend from agglutinative to inflective was identified by bernard h . bichakjian in his article " evolutionary patterns in linguistics " which appeared in studies in language origins , vol 2 , ed . walburga von raffler - engel , jan wind , and abraham jonker ( amsterdam / philadelphia : john benjamins , 1991 ) , pp . 187-224 . he also identifies some other trends in linguistic evolution . geoffrey sampson ( geoffs @ cogs . susx . ac . uk ) wrote : my memory is that adalbert schleicher , who was the first writer to describe language evolution as a natural process akin ( or even identical ) to biological evolution , thought of the movement from analytic to synthetic as a decay which came about after the intellectual progress of mankind had attained a point at which it no longer needed to be supported by specific linguistic structures - - and that this was linked to themes in hegel 's philosophy , about which i am deeply vague . > from ian dale ( iandale @ ccs . carleton . ca ) : i take it you are referring in the first instance to wilhelm von humboldt . a few quick references . edward sapir ( language , 1921 , chapter 6 ) deals rather extensively with a rather more detailed typological comparison , without specific reference to humboldt . charles f . hockett ( 1958 , a course in modern linguistics , p181 ) dismisses such ideas out of hand , without giving a reference . r . h . robins ( 1964 , general linguistics : an introductory survey , pp 331 - 335 ) also discusses this sort of classification and does refer specifically to humboldt 's " ueber die verschiedenheit des menschlichen sprachbaues , berlin , 1836 ( reprinted darmstadt , 1949 . " but as to any sort of " natural evolution " , all ( and i imagine this " all " would include nearly all linguists ) agree that this is out of the question , especially if " evolution " has anything to do with " progress , " and especially since most languages display both synthetic and analytic features ( not to speak of such other terms as polysynthetic , agglutinative , isolating , and inflecting ) . > from asya pereltsvaig ( asya @ mail . netvision . net . il ) hi , i do n't know if it 's of any help to you or it will just confuse you , but i remember reading somewhere of just the opposite approach : that languages develop from synthetic to analytic . however , i can't address you to a reference right now . laurie bauer ( laurie . bauer @ vuw . ac . nz ) writes : if it is , the history of romance from latin needs some explanation - - or english from germanic , for that matter . yet if you consider french le livre , je l ' ai lu , moi in terms of phonology instead of traditional word breaks , we could argue that we have le _ livre je _ l ' ai _ lu moi in three words , the middle one of which is synthetic , derived from a more analytic j ' ai lu le livre . so we find both directions occurring naturally . whew ! thanks to everyone . this has shown me that there is no simple answer and that i should just as likely believe the opposite as what i thought i had read . m melanie misanchuk department of french italian and spanish university of calgary calgary , alberta , canada

<subject> re : summary : ' no ' and ' man ' </subject> thanks for all the responses . it was really something to get the number and quality of ideas . 1 . ' no ' my initial query was : south african english use of ' no ' - does this occur in contexts such as : a . how are you ? b . no , i ' m fine . in other english varieties / other languages ? confronted with such examples , vistors to the country often comment that in sa english , ' no ' means ' yes ' . this , of course , is not true . ' no ' would be the response to the question ' do you have the time ? ' if the speaker did n't have the time . * generally : a couple of people commented that ' no ' definitely does not mean ' yes ' in these contexts . what it does is rather to negate the possibility of a negative belief concerning the answer to the question . in the example above , for instance , b . is negating a . 's possible belief that b . is not well . why south africans hold that the possibility of such negative beliefs is so strong they have to be denied remains to be seen . * ' no ' in other varieties of english the use of ' no ' in the types of examples cited anyway is not recorded according to the responses in : - australian english - american english - english english it is recorded in : - nigerian and ghanaian english there do appear to be related ( but not identical ) discourse uses of ' no ' and similar particles in other varieties of english . few english responses actually dealt with this usage at all . by far the majority were on ' man ' * ' no ' in other languages ' no ' does seem to be used in a variety of other languages in the same way as in sa english . similar uses are recorded in : - the scandinavian languages - german ( 'd och ' - similar but not identical ) - cameroon french - bangkok thai ( ' plaw ' - lit . ' empty ' ) - spanish ? it also occurs , incidentally , in afrikaans . 2 . ' man ' my question here related to the use of ' man ' to express a negative emotional involvement of the speaker of some sort - irritation , impatience or annoyance . examples given were : man it 's hot today hurry up mom , man man , i can't this right * english a huge response that showed that ' man ' is used similarly in : - american english ( both ' black ' and ' white ' ) - scottish english - tyneside english ( in north east of england ) - jamaican english - welsh english - an ' americanism ' found in other varieties of english . the american english usage at least does not necessary carry negative sentiment and is ' a more general tag . . . over which any kind of emotional intonation can be laid ' . example b . above , an example which typifies sa usage , was found to be odd ( ' wierd ' ) by american respondants . the reason for this is that ' man ' although an interjection still appears to ' have the flavour of a term of address so that ' mom , man ' sounds like two forms of direct address in a row ' . it seems , then , that ' man ' in sae does not bare the feature ' term of address ' at all in such contexts . the only instance in which similar usages were given was in tyneside english . ( ' shut up man geoff ' ' those kegs are too tight man mary ' . here though , the actual term of address occurs finally as opposed to the use of ' man ' finally in sae . this needs to be explored further , but of further interest : - there is a distinctly ' american ' use of ' man ' in sae that is not like the south african use of man ( ' cool man ' type of utterances ) . - other sa examples of man : - daddy , man ! ( 5 year old daughter after i stood on her toe ) - man , david , i do n't mean that ( wife and self in ' altercation ' ) - no man , that 's not right . - man ! this bloody computer is giving problems . - saenglish ' man ' alternates between shwa and full vowel in all contexts . ( in sae shwa occurs as a vowel in stressed contexts - 's it ' can have shwa for eg ) : related usage in currant american english is the use of 'd ude ' . * other languages related uses of ' man ' include : - dutch - swedish ( ' boy ' is used in a similar way ) - norwegian - ? german use of ' etwa ' may have similar function - german ( ' usually to indicate weariness ' ) - spanish - ? lhasa tibetan ( ' mi ' - ' person ' ) interestingly in dutch the 'd ouble address form [ as in ' hurry up mom , man ' ] is impossible ( just " schiet op , man " must do ) . ' some interesting stuff came out as you can see . just for your interest , on further sa english item : - ' sorry ' for ' i beg your pardon ' e . g . a drops something without knowing . b picks it up and calls out to a ' sorry , you dropped something ' anyway thanks to : helen adamson geoffrey sampson elin haf gruffyd jones celso alvarez caccamo mai kuha mark donohue marek przezdziecki scott delancey mats eeg-olofsson dom watt hilde hasselgard nicole nelson jane a . edwards sren harder charlie rowe nobue mori adiego lajara bruce connell krisadawan hongladarom frank bramlett deborah milam berkley douglas s oliver larry trask kristine hasund paul boersma m . lynne roecklein judy l . delin benji wald stephen p . spackman john verhaar randall major + the person who wished to be anonymous for the references .
<subject> disc : grammar in uk schools </subject> i was disturbed to find some traditional fallacies in geoffrey sampson 's discussion of the teaching of grammar in schools . though i no longer have a copy of prof . cameron 's original post , i do recall the essentials of it , and found that mr . sampson had passed over the valid point it was making in favour of a prescriptivist , " back to basics " defense of traditional grammatical education . prof . cameron is perfectly correct in ridiculing the inflexible , rote and prescriptive approach to grammar which is conventionally inflicted on students throughout the english speaking world . the issue of being able to use standard english ( or perhaps _ a _ standard english ) correctly is entirely separate from the reliance on traditional " rules " which are frequently unhelpful , and often grossly inaccurate . the rule regarding finishing sentences with prepositions , as one glaring example , is a total misunderstanding of both the history of english , and an unhelpful preoccupation for effective communication . > strikes me as akin to suggesting that teachers of > french should forget about teaching the past participle of " vivre " in > favour of getting their pupils to develop considered opinions about > the theories of derrida . though mr . sampson has used an interesting rhetorical image here , it is in fact a false analogy . teaching students to get a feel for the function of grammar and language is a far cry from teaching them gb theory or hpsg . an understanding of how sentences , clauses , verb tenses , adverbs , etc . actually function on a basic level is a very reasonable educational goal , and far more worthy then just creating a bunch of " do n't " 's and " never " 's and calling that grammatical education . > beyond that , though , teaching orthography and grammar at school level > has a much broader educational value . one of the lessons we all have > to learn is that nothing big and worthwhile is ever achieved in this > life without careful attention to endless tedious and often arbitrary > details . at the risk of making a gross national stereotype , i feel compelled to quote george bernard shaw : " the british believe that they are moral when they are merely uncomfortable . " this notion that education ( or work , for that matter ) must be unpleasant to produce results is a puritanical relic . in my personal experience , the very successful people tend to be precisely the ones who know how to delegate , slough off or avoid wasting time with " tedious and arbitrary details " . ( please read the preceding paragraph with the tongue planted in the general vicinity of the cheek . ) in a spirit of greater seriousness though , i would like to second prof . cameron 's call to educators to abandon prescriptive , rule-based approaches to grammar , and embrace a more general approach based on a comprehension of more fluid and meaningful principles . i believe that the result would be students with a better grasp of the form and function of language rather than a shallow and inflexible mastery of facile rules . - - - - marc hamann
<subject> re : 8 . 792 , disc : grammar in uk schools - - a response </subject> i was fascinated by geoffrey sampson 's defense of traditional educational language standards , and cannot resist commenting on some points . he says : it seems to me that teaching correct usage , the > standard terminology for elements of grammar and punctuation , and the > ability to remedy formal errors in faulty prose are exactly the kinds > of thing that need to be taught in this area at secondary-school > level . to say that school pupils should be taught to engage in > " explicit , systematic reflection on what it is that we are doing when > we use language " strikes me as akin to suggesting that teachers of > french should forget about teaching the past participle of " vivre " in > favour of getting their pupils to develop considered opinions about > the theories of derrida . even assuming this type of cognitive > achievement is worthwhile in principle , it is quite impractical for > the average secondary-school class to attain it . setting aside the possible implication of elitism in the phrase " the * average * secondary-school class " , i view the charge of " impracticality " with suspicion , since it is a typical way of dismissing any innovation . it means " it 's very nice but there 's no time for it . we have already identified the priorities , and we ' re having trouble getting them through in the time we have . " cf . we have no time or money to investigate the " so-called " causes of crime , because there 's so much of it that we can hardly keep up with the demand for more prisons - - that 's the top priority - no time for anything else , thanks anyway . nevertheless , in principle i was not put off , and read on to find out why the top priorities are what they are . i was not disappointed , though the rationale offered seemed predictable to me , and also arguable . > people need to learn to write their national language accurately > because much of modern life depends on complex written communication , > and prose that is full of unsystematic deviations from the conventions > interferes with successful communication , as dirty windows interfere > with successful vision - - the message gets lost amid problems with the > medium . people need a terminology for talking about the bits and > pieces of language , as a car mechanic needs to know the names of the > parts of a motor , in order to provide an apparatus for thinking out > what has gone wrong and how to cure it when prose does n't " work " . this all sounds reasonable . and i am indeed in favor of students knowing these things . in fact , prescriptive grammatical terminology and analysis do set a foundation even for what linguists do when they " engage in explicit , systematic reflection on what it is that we are doing when we use language " namely , linguists start with the traditional categories , explore their motivations and then discuss where they seem to be inadequate and what would be more adequate , in view of whatever larger linguistic facts are brought to bear on whatever problem of traditional grammar . . . i realise , of course , that geoff is not arguing for this - - and so i wonder if traditional grammatical analysis etc . is either necessary or sufficient for effective " complex communication " . probably nobody would defend the " sufficient " condition in view of much obscure , if not incomprehensible , ( though " grammatically " flawless ) standard writing , but i also wonder about the necessary " condition " . that is , do you have to be able to analyse to imitate the standard way of writing ? is the standard that different from a " natural " language ( first learned type ) ? ( at least with some good , also professional , creative writers i know , they are not actually aware of some of the key elements of their style , e . g . , one who is very effective in using and even coining nominal compounds , but did not show recognition of this as a characteristic of his style when i mentioned it to him . ) thus , i am not challenging the notion of a standard or necesarily the demand for its use in certain contexts , but how it is presented , esp . is it this great logical thing it 's generally portrayed as , that 's gonna solve all those " communication " problems that have alarmed english publishers since the time of caxton ? but even more , does it have to be * explicitly * taught ? ( maybe a lot of teachers screw up teaching " grammar " , because that 's where a lot of students complain they get irremediably bored and just want to get the hell out of the classroom . who knows , even linguistics might be more popular , if many students had n't earlier been turned off to " grammar " . ) > beyond that , though , teaching orthography and grammar at school level > has a much broader educational value . one of the lessons we all have > to learn is that nothing big and worthwhile is ever achieved in this > life without careful attention to endless tedious and often arbitrary > details . i can't see a better domain for learning this lesson than > the orthography and grammar of one 's national language : it contains > the tedious details , but it relates to material which surrounds the > child in his everyday life . this is the discipline and " moral fibre " argument , which is the last ditch attempt at enforcing authoritarianism . as a friend of mine , an english teacher observed , his supervisor is an ambitious man , and a stickler for discipline . night school students should not wear hats in class , says the supervisor . so my friend the teacher told one recalcitrant student that once ( these are night school adults ) . the student took it off and put it right back on . my friend said . that 's it . i ' m here to teach english . he 's not bothering anybody else . i ' m not going to get sucked into some authority game . but school for children is full of such petty discipline things that are insisted upon along with learning " subjects " . obediance is more important than understanding . the argument is that the discipline that comes from obedience will lead to understanding in time , if there is any argument at all , cf . learning declensions and conjugations before approaching texts . ( and often the teachers do n't even know why something is insisted on . they just know that they have to be obeyed , or else the authoritarian structure collapses , and their supervisors will come down on them . ) this is what lots of kids resent about school . probably not the same ones who actually like to cause disturbances ( or can't control themselves somehow ) . is anyone unfamiliar from their childhood with what i ' m referring to ? so what basically is this " discipline " argument . it seems to me the argument is : the student who has mastered standard english has demonstrated ability ( not necessarily inclination ) to follow relatively complex orders and routines , and therefore can be considered capable for positions in hierarchies where following fairly complex orders is considered necessary ( or at least desirable ) . little wonder some actually call this behavioral skill " morality " . but can i question geoff 's rationale without questioning his view of " ( british ) civilization " ( that 's a quote from his message ) ? i do n't know . - - benji
<subject> re : 8 . 792 , disc : grammar in uk schools - - a response </subject> having been engaged in the same sort of debate for several decades on this side of the atlantic , i tend to agree with professor sampson 's remarks on the value of teaching grammar in the uk schools . but because we do not all agree on _ what _ " grammar " should be taught , and because the public , even the educated public , even school teachers and administrators , are , at least in the u . s . , ignorant of the last century 's work in linguistics , teaching grammar does not turn out to be as easy as professor sampson seems to imply it is . for example , for many , probably most , linguists " correct usage " is not part of grammar . as a sociolinguist , i would prefer that correct usage be taught in secondary schools - - but clearly labeled as something other than grammar . and even within what nearly all of us would consider " grammar , " what should be taught . most educators ( sic ) in the u . s . and most politician would seem to prefer traditional grammar , which we linguists have misnamed " prescriptive grammar " ( when it is actually mostly proscriptive ) . to me , teaching traditional grammar has all the attraction of teaching phlogiston theory to non-scientists and passing it off as serious science . many of my colleagues in linguistics disagree . so the question is not " should grammar be taught in uk schools ? " but rather " what sort of grammar should be taught ( everywhere , i think ) ? " carl mills university of cincinnati
<subject> disc : functionalism 8 . 798 </subject> this is in response to benji wald 's comments on ( 8 . 736 , disc ) functionalism : i fear that we may be talking a little at cross-purposes here . my main interest is in clarifying the position of natural phonology on the issue of so-called contradictory processes . benji seems a little more focused on the question of what it means to call something a " cluster " in phonetic terms . < deleted : elaboration on the nature of phonetic clusters , particularly [ pt ] > > > the question , if i remember correctly , > > was why speakers should be able to pronounce the reduced [ pt ] > > if they could n't pronounce the unreduced one . > > in view of what i have said above , i understand that the phonological > processes involved are not consciously controllable , and that reduction ( or > whatever ? ) of the first vowel in " potato " reflects a process which normally > occurs when speech is not deliberate or conscious , but when it is > relatively spontaneous . so we ' re dealing with unconscious stylistic > effects , in my view . i can agree with you here . this is yet another reason for believing that the fast speech reduction of [ p @ t ] to [ pt ] ( or whatever ) poses no problem at all for natural phonological theory . the fortition that breaks up a controlled attempt to pronounce initial [ pt ] would not necessarily have to apply to what is loosely described as " [ pt ] " ( i . e . reduced [ p @ t ] ) in fast speech . > > > > the fact that you can't pronounce the cluster in no way means that the > > > > cluster is banned as a side-effect in the pronunciation of some other > > > > phonetic target . > > that just goes along with what i just said , but sounds absurd because it > does not explicitly acknowledge the difference between consciously > controllable phonological processes , and unconscious , spontaneous , but > nevertheless learned / acquired , processes . am i missing that somehow the > theory at issue does indeed account for this distinction ? does it even > recognise it ? or , should it ? yes on all counts . thank you for clarifying that . natural phonology is a theory about pronounceability . that was part of baudouin 's original vision when he founded modern phonological theory . it is no longer necessarily part of the modern vision of what phonology is about . basically , baudouin observed that phonetic alternations all fell into just two types - - those that involved phonetic variants of a single " phoneme " and those that involved two distinct phonemes . as stampe has pointed out many times , the latter are consciously manipulable . the former are quite unconscious and difficult to control . by the way , it is interesting that later generations seem to have lost their way , thanks due in no small part to baudouin 's influential student shcherba . it was shcherba who seemed to have influenced the concept of the phoneme among british ( thence american ) linguists . shcherba limited the phoneme to be just a perceptual unit , which radically changed linguistic analyses of what was includable or excludable from the study of phonology ( i . e . phonemics at the time ) . trubetzkoy retained baudouin 's essential vision of the boundaries of phonology , but he preferred a more " scherbemic " conception of the phoneme . so he had to have " archiphonemes " in his phonology , which he still considered a separate branch of linguistic theory from morphophonology . sapir , who carried on a close correspondence with trubetzkoy , also retained this sharp distinction between phonology ( i . e . stampean processes ) and morphophonology ( i . e . stampean rules ) . what ties all of these approaches together is that pronounceability is fundamental to the concept of phonological theory ( although trubetzkoy might not have explicitly agreed with this claim ) . > ( self - conscious speech is indeed the suppression of some phonetic > realisation rules , but depending on how deep your phonology - - > morphophonemics ? - - is , it is never the elimination of everything short of > " deep " phonotactics , right ? in fact , i ask : is self-conscious speech ever > anything but the suppression of some realisation rules , i . e . , does it ever > * really * include the addition of a rule ? that might be an interesting > question for some theorists . ) there are some hidden assumptions in the above that make it difficult to comment on , so i ' ll just tackle the one red flag that you raised for me . a theory of phonology need not have any phonotactics , deep or otherwise . since generative theory is about well-formedness , it must address such phenomena as part of the theory . however , natural phonology just sees banned sequences of sounds as those which cannot be directly ( or intentionally ) pronounced during normal speech . unpronounceability need not necessarily be attributable to a single cause . since you do n't need to pronounce nonexistent phonetic structures , you do n't need to suppress any processes that affect them . hence , there can be multiple processes banning so-called phonotactically impermissible sequences . hence , no need for a single generalization in your theory to ban such sequences . < . . . > > > stampean theory predicts > > that very early language learners will have both devoicing of > > vowels between voiceless consonants and voicing of consonants between > > vowels . ( in fact , such processes do occur in l1 acquisition , but they > > are not observed - - may not even be manifested - - in all learners . having > > them does n't mean that they actually have to become dominant during > > phonological acquisition . they do in some learners , but not all . ) > > again , are these established facts ? or are we just going to hear somebody > say what they think they heard their little daughter say in the playpen or > in the highchair the other day ? this issue desrves serious study , and i > would like to know what actual observations have been made , and what > documentation exists for these " facts " admittedly crucial to this theory > ( and relevant to any other theory ) . the quote has so much hedging , i > wonder if its evidence is distinguishable from grasping at straws . i refer you to stampe 's writings on phonological acquisition , particularly the 1973 published version of his dissertation . much of his early work was based on an explanation of longitudinal studies of child speech . indeed , there are plenty of studies on the subject , the seminal one being jakobson 's " child language , aphasia , and phonological universals " monograph . what i ' m not sure about is what you will accept as " established fact " . if you want spectrograms , then i ' m not sure that this body of literature is going to impress you much . however , if you accept that body of literature as basically accurate in how it recorded child phonetics , then you won't find many linguists other than stampe who can explain the recorded evolutionary stages . > > i know that stampean theory is very different - - quite strange to some > > people . it requires one to treat acquisition as a kind of " loss " of > > pre-existing rules . > > it 's not strange to any theory based on a " universal grammar ( include > phonology ) " approach . but what does a universal phonology claim about > surface ( presumably observable ) phonetics ? oops ! red flag again . : ) universal grammar is about the construction of grammars , not behavioral systems . stampean derivations are not " grammatical " in the generative sense . for example , there are no restrictions on what you can plug into a phonological derivation in np ( no phonotactic conditions , remember ? ) . you can try to pronounce any phonetic target , so anything can be run through the " filter " that the process system represents . that includes surface phonetics . presumably , that is how both children and adults acquire new phonologies . they try to say things . generative theory just tells you what people think is legal . it does n't have anything to say about how people pronounce things . one can * speculate * about a connection between the grammar and pronounceability , but there is nothing inherent in generativism that makes you go there . < . . . > > > if markedness > > theory were really correct , then why did n't the human race converge on > > the same phonology ages ago ? what keeps phonologies different if there > > is some kind of gold standard that we all use to arrive at grammatical > > analyses with ? > > good question . what 's the answer ? i ' m glad you enjoyed the question . i leave it up to proponents of markedness theory to answer it . ; - ) natural phonology holds that no such standard exists . there is no " universal grammar " . just a lot of sometimes contradictory constraints on pronunceation that have to be put in order by the language learners . basically , phonology exists to coordinate articulatory gestures during speech . ( that explains a lot , by the way . it explains sapir 's famous conundrum about the difference between blowing out a candle and producing a speech sound . ) acquisition is the act of coordinating your mouth to pass just those phonetic structures that you need to get out . > natural phonology simply takes the view that we put > > naturally-occuring , but chaotic behavioral constraints , into some kind > > of order , depending on what challenges the target language poses for > > the articulators . what you do with contradictory processes depends on > > what you have to say . > > was that the answer ? what are examples of " naturally-occurring , but > chaotic behavioral constraints " ? can i get away with just referring you to examples in the donegan & stampe " the study of natural phonology " paper ? they do a pretty good job of talking about contradictory processes in that work . by " chaotic " , i mean that the way in which processes interact during l1 is not predictable . it depends on what they child attempts to pronounce . there need not be any single correct path to a properly coordinated speech tract . - rick wojcik bellevue , wa rickw @ eskimo . com http : / / www . eskimo . com / ~ rickw

<subject> disc : evolution analytic > synthetic </subject> as far as i can tell , melanie misanchuk 's query > i once read that the natural evolution of a language is from > analytic to synthetic . i ' ve been unable to find that assertion > since , and am wondering if i made it up . has been answered very inadequately . since her summary was posted on linguist , i feel that some corrections are necessary . judging from some of the replies melanie received , the view is still widespread that linguistic evolution can go in both directions , i . e . that there is no inherent directionality in language change . this is wrong . at the same time , we can't say globally that languages tend to change either from synthetic to analytic ( as some 19th century linguists thought ) or vice versa . what is going on is quite simple : we have to look at constructions , not at languages . we then see that there is a universal directionality of change : analytic constructions always turn into synthetic constructions ( unless they die out ) , and synthetic constructions are always replaced by newly created analytic constructions . ) that is , synthetic constructions never turn into analytic constructions , and analytic constructions are never replaced by newly created synthetic constructions . ( so both synthetic > analytic and analytic > synthetic are universal , but in different senses . ) when quite a few synthetic constructions are simultaneously replaced by analytic constructions , then one can get the impression that the language as a whole changes from the synthetic type to the analytic type - - this is what 19th century linguists such as august schlegel , wilhelm von humboldt , august schleicher , max mueller and others emphasized . ( the cycle mentioned by rob pensalfini was first described by georg von der gabelentz in 1891 . ) at the same time , 19th century linguists ( e . g . franz bopp and william d . whitney ) also recognized that the development from analytic to synthetic ( which they called agglutination , now called grammaticalization ) is possible and common , but they were confuded because they tended to think in terms of languages rather than constructions . it is true that 19th century linguists had some preconceptions about their own languages ( actually , latin and greek ) being the best languages , but this does not mean that all their insights are totally discredited . martin haspelmath , free university of berlin / university of bamberg

" prosody and the acquisition of grammatical morphemes in chinese languages " indiana university linguistics club . in this comparison study , hung investigates the influence of prosodic and phonological factors on the acquisition of frequently occurring grammatical morphemes in two morphosyntactically similar but prosodically different languages , namely taiwan mandarin chinese and taiwanese . through an analysis of the patterns of realization and omission of these morphemes in children 's speech , he concludes that rhythmic characteristics of languages can affect segmentation of input speech by providing different kinds of prosodic handles for the novice to grasp . metrical feet may offer mandarin children one kind of segmentation handle . in taiwanese , however , the syllable more likely functions as a segmentation unit .

<subject> muc - 7 call for participation </subject> * * * call for participation * * * seventh message understanding system evaluation and message understanding conference ( muc - 7 ) evaluation : 2 - 6 march 1998 conference : april 1998 washington , d . c . area sponsored by : the human language systems tipster text program of the defense advanced research projects agency information technology office ( darpa / ito ) the message understanding conferences have provided on ongoing forum for assessing the state of the art and practice in text analysis technology and for exchanging information on innovative computational techniques in the context of fully implemented systems that perform realistic tasks . the evaluations have provided researchers and potential sponsors and customers with a quantitative means to appreciate the strengths and weaknesses of the technologies , and the results reported on at the conferences have sparked customer interest in the potential utility of the technologies . the seventh message understanding conference ( muc - 7 ) will provide an opportunity for both new and experienced muc participants to participate in a flexible evaluation , suited to development needs and abilities . it will provide : * opportunity to select among a variety of tasks : named entity ( ne ) , coreference ( co ) , template element ( te ) , template relationship ( tr ) and scenario template ( st ) . * two tasks for evaluating component technologies ( ne and co ) , which use standard generalized markup language ( sgml ) as output format * redesigned information extraction ( ie ) task , with two domain-independent subtasks ( te and tr ) separated from domain-dependent subtask ( st ) . * emphases of st task on portability and on minimizing human resources required to participate in the evaluation . * three experimental tracks to explore new data sets and tasks . participation in muc - 7 is actively sought from both new and veteran organizations . with the new and redesigned evaluation tasks , muc - 7 offers a good opportunity for organizations to try out new ideas for handling nlp problems that are of both scientific and practical interest without having to participate in the entire range of tasks . the conference itself will consist primarily of presentations and discussions of innovative techniques , system design , and test results . there will also be an opportunity for participants to demo their evaluation systems . attendance at the conference is limited to evaluation participants and to guests invited by the darpa tipster text program . a conference proceedings , including test results , will be published . schedule : 1 july 97 : application deadline for participation 15 july 97 : release of ne , co , te , tr , and example st training data and scorer 8 september 97 : release of dry run st task definition , training data , and scorer 29 sept - 3 oct 97 : muc - 7 dry run ( all participants ) 6 february 98 : release of formal test st task definition , training data , and scorer 2 - 6 march 98 : muc - 7 formal run 7 - 9 april 98 : 7th message understanding conference ( tentative dates ) data and task description : the texts to be used for system development and testing are news service articles from the new york times news service , supplied by the linguistic data consortium ( ldc ) [ ldc @ ldc . upenn . edu ] . training , dry run , and test data for all the tasks are extracted from a corpus of approximately 158 , 000 articles . sets of articles to be used in the muc - 7 evaluation will be distributed via ftp upon payment of a one time fee of $ 100 and upon signing of a user agreement for the use of these texts . the user agreement can be retrieved from the ldc catalog ( evaluation agreements ) . the url for the ldc home page is : http : / / www . ldc . upenn . edu . five separate evaluations will be conducted as part of muc - 7 . the definition of these evaluations has been worked out since late 1996 by members of the muc - 7 planning committee . the evaluations may be viewed as capturing the results of text analysis at various levels of aggregation of information : * named entity ( ne ) requires only that the system under evaluation identify each bit of pertinent information in isolation from all others . * coreference ( co ) requires connecting all references to " identical " entities . * template element ( te ) requires grouping entity attributes together into entity " objects . " * template relationship ( tr ) requires identifying relationships between template elements . * scenario template ( st ) requires identifying instances of a task-specific event and identifying event attributes , including entities that fill some role in the event ; the overall information content is captured via interlinked " objects . " * experimental tracks using new data sets are variants of the ne task . the task definition is the same as for the basic ne task , but the texts are different . * experimental track involving a new task is a simplified version of the te task . key things to note about each evaluation task : * ne covers named organizations , people , and locations , along with date / time expressions and monetary and percentage expressions ; it requires production of sgml tags as output . * co covers noun phrases ( common and proper ) and personal pronouns that are " identical " in their reference ; it requires production of sgml tags as output ; the tags for coreferring strings form " equivalance " classes , which are used for scoring . * te covers organizations , persons , and artifacts , which are captured in the form of template " objects " consisting of a predefined set of attributes . * tr covers relationships among template elements , including location and time relationships , which are captured in the form of template " relations " consisting of a relationship and the template elements participating in that relationship . tr is a new task for muc - 7 . * st covers a particular scenario , which is kept secret until one month prior to testing in order to focus on system portability ; however , the generalized structure of a scenario template is predefined , and example scenarios are available for participants to examine . this task is domain dependent . * tasks for the experimental tracks are derived from ne and te . there is a world wide web site that allows automated testing following the rules of muc - 6 . it will be of particular value to new participants . the website is password protected and you need to be licensed to access the acl / dci disk from the ldc to obtain a password from chinchor @ gso . saic . com . muc - 6 articles were taken from the acl / dci disk . an anonymous ftp site will be available for downloading muc - 7 related material . this cfp and the muc - 7 participant agreement are available to the public from the ftp site . each participant ( after signing the ldc user agreement and a muc - 7 participation agreement ) will receive a password to download the muc - 7 data , definitions , and scoring software at the release times noted above . the url of the website is http : / / muc . saic . com . the ftp site is ftp . muc . saic . com . test protocol and evaluation criteria : muc - 7 participants may elect to do one or any combination of tasks and experimental tracks . participants will have access to shared resources such as the training texts and annotations / templates , task documentation , and scoring software . all muc - 7 participants are encouraged to participate in the dry run and take advantage of material available . the formal test will be conducted during the first week in march . it will be carried out by the participants at their own sites in accordance with a prepared test procedure and the results submitted to the ftp site for official scoring with the software prepared by saic for muc - 7 . test sets used for the evaluations will consist of 100 texts , with subsets for some of the tasks . there will be different data sets for the dry run and the formal test . systems will be evaluated using recall and precision metrics ( all tasks ) , f - measure ( all tasks ) , and error-based metrics ( all tasks except co ) . the computation of these metrics is based on the scoring categories of correct , partial , incorrect , spurious , missing , and noncommittal . muc - 7 participants will be able to familiarize themselves with the evaluation criteria through usage of the evaluation software , which will be released along with the training data . instructions for responding to the call for participation : organizations within and outside the u . s . are invited to respond to this call for participation . by the time of the actual testing phase of the evaluation , systems must be able to accept texts without manual preprocessing , process them without human intervention , and output annotations ( ne , co ) or templates ( te , tr , st ) in the expected format . organizations should plan on allocating approximately two person-months of effort for participation in the evaluation and conference . it is understood that organizations will vary with respect to experience with sgml text annotation , information extraction , domain expertise / engineering , resources , contractual demands / expectations , etc . recognition of such factors will be made in any analyses of the results . organizations wishing to participate in the evaluation and conference must respond by july 1 , 1997 by submitting a short statement of interest via email and a signed copy of the muc - 7 participation agreement via surface mail . 1 . the statement of interest should be submitted via email to marsh @ aic . nrl . navy . mil and should include the following : a . evaluation task ( s ) ( choose one or more ) * named entity * coreference * template element * template relationship * scenario template b . primary point of contact . please include name , surface and email addresses , and phone and fax numbers . c . does your site have a copy of the muc -

<subject> sum : expressions like ' put them away yet ? ' </subject> a big thank you to the persons who commented on my query ( linguist , vol . 8-808 ) on expressions like ' put them away yet ? ' : j . atkinson , r . m . brend , b . clark , c . davenport , d . dee , m . donohue , m . farris , n . frishberg , d . harris , j . hilferty , l . horn , d . houghton , p . lesourd , r . mc callister , c . d . nilep , j . reighard , p . svenonius , m . swart , g . h . toops , l . trask , r . wright the result is quite definite . a ) my impression that ( 2 ) see them yet ? ( 3 ) get them yet ? ( 4 ) write him yet ? ( 5 ) hear it yet ? will have a present tense reading , and that a simple past reading is not possible , has been rejected almost unanimously by my informants ( only a couple of british english speakers among them ) . for most of them the simple past interpretation is in fact dominant over the present tense interpretation ; some informants even have difficulties in imagining an appropriate situation for a present tense reading ; others , though , have reported no problems here . b ) when expressions such as ( 2 ) - ( 5 ) are used with a non-present tense meaning , there is no distinction made and perceived between meanings associated with simple past in contrast to present perfect in other constructions . ( this , then , supports bolinger saying with respect to ' put them away yet ? ' : " i do not force you to an either-or choice between the two compatible meanings ' did you put them away yet ? ' and ' have you put them away yet ? ' , in spite of formal differences , elsewhere in the structure between _ see _ , and _ seen _ , _ do _ and _ done _ , _ go _ and _ gone _ , etc . " . and this is what i referred to in my query as ' indeterminedness ' of meaning in contrast to ' ambiguity ' . ) c ) a number of further comments have been made , e . g . concerning the influence of context on the interpretation of these expression ; concerning the influence of the semantic class of the verbs in these expressions on their interpretation ; concerning the influence of the presence of _ yet _ . meanwhile i have found the following note in quirk et al . 's _ comprehensive grammar of the english language _ : " in ame , the simple past is often preferred to the present perfective for the variants of the indefinite past discussed in this section [ 4 . 22 ] . compare [ _ have the children come home yet ? _ ] , for example , with _ did the children come home yet ? _ < esp ame > .

<subject> re : 8 . 826 , disc : evolution analytic > synthetic </subject> just to add a little more to the value judgment part of martin haspelmath 's very clear explication of current views of the evolution of typology , i should point out that otto jespersen believed that the evolution from synthetic to analytic ( such as has happened between old and modern english ) was an overall improvement , with an assumption that totally isolating languages like chinese represented the ideal goal of languages . i do n't have my copy easily available , but i believe this view can be found in the philosophy of grammar . i have heard it suggested that the reason j believed this was he believed english was close to an ideal language . i second martin 's claim that the view that there is a fairly clear consensus among historical linguists about the directionality he discusses . current introductory texts certainly include discussion of this view - - a nice discussion can be found , for example in terry crowley 's _ an introduction to historical linguistics _ ( oxford , 1992 ) , and similar discussions can be found in other current texts . geoff geoffrey s . nathan department of linguistics southern illinois university at carbondale , carbondale , il , 62901 usa phone : + 618 453-3421 ( office ) fax + 618 453-6527 + 618 549-0106 ( home )
<subject> re : 8 . 836 , disc : punctuation </subject> there have been several postings recently decrying the use of apostrophe-s to make an english plural form , e . g . " dyslexic 's " , " sonata 's " . on what grounds is this held to be bad english ? like everyone else , i learnt at school that the apostrophe was not to be used in english plurals except for a few exceptional cases like numerals and letters ( " the 1990 's " , " three a 's " ) . this last usage seems to have gone out of fashion recently , but apostrophes are in practice widely used in all sorts of plural forms , and they seem to have a long history of use at least in foreign or unusual words - i ' ve noticed apostrophised plurals in facsimiles of several seventeenth century books recently . exactly what are the grounds for condemning this usage ? john phillips

<subject> shor </subject> the revival of the shor literaly language . irina nevskaya , mainz . summary the article is devoted to the present-day sociolinguistic situation in mountain shoriya ( russia , the south of western siberia , the kemerovo region ) . the indigenous population of mountain shoriya are the shors who speak one of the siberian turkic languages . the shor language has survived in spite of unfavourable circumstances . until very recently , it was neither written nor taught at school for half a century . at present , the shors try to restore social functions to the language . the turcological traditions at the novokuznetsk state pedagogical institute have facilitated ( and even instigated ) the revival of the shor literary language . the article touches upon the history of literary shor and of shor language research in novokuznetsk , and analyzes recent developments in shoriya : the revival of shor language school teaching , and of written shor . special attention is paid to problems facing shor turcologists who were providing the revival process with scientific back-up . the article will be fully published in one of the next issues of the journal turkic languages here we present some extracts of it . general information the shors are one of the minor indigenous turkic peoples of siberia . in the former ussr there were slightly over 16 , 000 shors . 12 , 585 of them , according to the census of 1989 , lived in kuzbass ( the kemerovo region ) , in the south of western siberia [ itogi 1989 , 42 ] . . . the shors inhabit mountain shoriya , the northern part of the sayan - altay mountain region . the ethnonym was introduced by the academician v . v . radlov at the end of the nineteenth century . the ethnonym , which came to be used officially , was originally the name of one of the turkic family clans or tribes ( sooks ) who spoke rather similar turkic dialects . the turks of altay also used the terrn ' shor ' for the turkic - speaking population of the kondoma ( shor lfondumj , mrassu ( shor pras ) and tom ( shor tom ) river basins . at that time , this population did not have a general native name . as the official and native name oftthis ethnos , the ethnonym spread in the mid - 1 ^ 30 's , during the beginning of the national cansolidation of the turkic sayan - altay ethnic groups . the ethnic group formed from various turkic and non - turkic sources . the ethnonym ' aba ' , the name of one of tolax sooks , is encountered in chinese sources dating from 603 [ pritsak 1959 , 630 ] . the shors are considered to be turkicized ob - ugrians : linguistic , ethnographic and anthropological research shows thz presence of an ob - ugric substratum in the ethnos : in the toponymy of shoriya there are a lot of ket names ( e . g . the river names ending in * zas / + sas ) , indicating that the region was inhabited earlier by the kets . many questions of shor ethnic history have not yet been solved . as a separate nation with selfidentification and national sentiment , it formed within the turkic - speaking population of this region during the last three centuries . the shor ethnologist dr . valery kimeev delineates 3 periods of the ethnos history [ kimeev 1994 , 4 - 6 ] . 1 . the formation of territorial ethnic groups of the shors within the administrative ethnic territory ( russian kuzneckij uezd ) , from the beginning of the seventeenth until the beginning of the twentieth century . 2 . national and cultural consolidation in the framework of the autonomous national district ( cor / lo-swo / skij nacional ' nyj / ajon ) , 1926 - 1939 . at that time , the processes of national development were very intensive . the most important contributing factors were the development of the literary language , school instruction in shor and the spreading of literacy among the shor population . 3 . from the early 1940 's until very recently , the shor nation in the conditions of active spreading of the dominant russian culture . within these years the shors lost their literary language and were at the brink of full assimilation . socio - linguistic situation in shordya in the late 1980 's the shor language has survived despite unfavourable circumstances . the fast industrial development of the area in the twentieth century almost destroyed the traditional shor way of life and had a profound influence on the area . the mass inflow of mainly russian speaking migrants initiated assimilation processes which threatened not only the shor language but also the very existence of the shor nation . beginning in the 1950 's , the following new economic and social factors emerged : small farms were merged , and many shor villages disappeared ; people , in search of work , had to move to cities ( where the processes of assimilation moved even faster ) ; the rural population was reduced , the urban population in mountainshoriya grew ; schools in small shor villages were closed ; shor boarding schools were opened ( these were primary and secondary educational establishments in big villages and industrial centers where shor children lived apart from their families during the academic year and were instructed in russian ) . as a result , by the end of the 1980 's , shor came to have a lower social status it was not a written language , nor a language of school education . furthermore , its transmission to younger generations had almost stopped , and the number of speakers had dramatically diminished . the language competence of speakers was reduced , especially of urban shors ( only 3 % of urban shors could speak shor fluently in 1986 versus 20 . 1 % in 1976 ) , while their competence in russian increased . in 1989 only 59 . 4 % of the shors considered shor to be their mother tongue , versus 76 . 6 % in 1970 . the number of shors who considered russian to be their mother tongue increased from 24 . 4 % up to 39 . 1 % [ itogi , 1989 , 42 ] . we see that people preferred to give up their mother tongue . the history of the shor literary language is important for the analysis of the factors which led to this situation . general information on the history of the shor litera / y language shor could be called one of the " oppressed languages " of the former ussr . within the twentieth century alone , the shor language lost its literary tradition twice . the first time was just after the october revolution in russia , when the church schools founded by the altay missionaries were closed . the altay missionaries preached in the native languages of siberia 's aborigines . they published books in indigenous languages of the siberian people , founded primary , secondary schools , and religious tertiary schools where they trained national priests and teachers for shor schools . one of the first primary schools in shoriya was opened in the village of kuzedeevo by the wellknown missionary and linguist v . 1 . verbitsky who taught at this school . by the time of the october revolution there were schools in all the larger villages . in the northern part of shoriya , about 40 % of the population was literate . shor was the language of school teaching , written communication , literature . the shor literature of the time was sparse ; there were only shor translations of religious literature , and original works . after 1917 , with the outbreak of the revolution and civil war , all schools were closed , and hence the literary tradition was interrupted . in 1927 the shor national district was formed . though the district did not exist long ( it was annulled in 1939 ) , this was an important period for the development of the shortliterary language . it was taught at schools ; a considerable number of books in shor were published ( more th , an 150 titles ) and the language , folklore and ethnology of the shors were studied intensively . however , the tragic events of 1937-45 had a devastating effect on the culture of the shors . in 1942 , the last issue of the shor language newspaper " kyzl sor " ( ' red shoriya ' ) was published , and all the shor schools closed . frqm this time on , the shor language was no longer written or taught at schools for half a century . the sphere of its functioning was minimal : it was only used at home for everyday topics . all other cultural needs were met by russian , which was the language of education , of literary works , of the mass media , as well as of administrative , political , and economic relations . during this period , several generations of urban shors grew up with at best minimal competence in shor . at present , history gives the shor language a chance ( probably the last one ) to become a literary language . the active growth of shor national sentiment and political activity , their interest in the national culture and language , and changes in the country as a whole can contribute to this . the revival of literary shor began with the publishing of textbooks of shor , the training of shor language teachers , and the teaching of shor at schools and in shor language circles . the revival of teaching shor at schools in 1988 , a chair of the shor language and literature was created at the novokuznetsk state pedagogical institute ( ngpi ) . the first head was prof . andrey chudoyakov . the same year a shor department was established in the faculty of philology and teacher training in shor language and literature began . a year later , teachers of different subjects who were shors themselves began to teach shor in a number of schools . they were graduates of a 2 - year course of training leaders for shor language circles . the course was organized in novokuznetsk by dr . alisa esipova . the shor alphabet book and textbooks for the primary years were written by dr . nadezhda kurpeshko ( kemerovo ) and members of the department . in 1994 , the first graduates of the national department ( 5 people ) began to work at schools in the kemerovo region . at present , about 20 teachers of shor work at schools in the tashtagol and mezhdurechensk districts of mountain shoriya , both in cities and villages . some schools which were closed 10-30 years ago resumed teaching . some schools were rebuilt . turcology in novokuznetsk the revival process was facilitated ( or , perhaps , even instigated ) by turcological traditions at the novokuznetsk state pedagogical institute . during the 50 crucial years of shor language history , the collecting , compiling and describing of all still available material has not stopped . the shor language research has been carried out mainly by university foreign-language teachers at the novokuznetsk state pedagogical institute . when in late eighties we witnessed the uprise of shor national sentiment and the desire to restore social functions to the language , there had already been qualified people ( among them also shors ) who could cope with this task . initially , the most important task facing such linguists was to provide the revival process with scientific back-up : to create a modern orthography for shor , to choose a standard dialect , and to work out literary norms . references itogi vsesojuznoj perepisi naselenija 1989 goda . vypusk 4 . nacional ' nyj sostav . 1990 . kemerovo : kemerovskoe kniznoe izdatel 's tvo . patruseva , g . m . 1994 . sovremennye etniceskie processy u sorcev . in : kimeev , v . m . & lavrent ' eva , l . a . & tokmasev , j . k . & sogrina , n . a . & bobrov , v . v . & nevskaja , i . a . & tivjakov , s . d .

<subject> call for papers : dgfs meeting 1998 </subject> call for papers as part of the annual meeting of the german linguistic society ( deutsche gesellschaft fuer sprachwissenschaft ) , to be held in halle ( saale ) , germany , march 4 / 6 1988 , there will be a workshop ( arbeitsgruppe ) on the following topic : the linguistic analysis of intercultural communication in the last thirty years research on intercultural communication has attracted increasing scientific attention not only as a result of social developments but also due to the growing interdisciplinary cooperation between different disciplines such as cultural anthropology , ethnology , sociology , and linguistics ( c . f . ehlich 1996 ) . a central topic of the linguistic analysis of intercultural communication is determined by the experience that the use of a common language system does not guarantee mutual understanding . therefore , the theoretical conception of intercultural communication ( either in everyday or in institutional situations ) is characterized by misunderstandings ( gumperz ) . analyses of the mediation of intercultural competences show that both contrastive and interactive investigations into intercultural communication are important in order to answer the questions on the contextualizations of speech actions and on their universal or culture specific characteristics . only recently , has the innovative potential of intercultural communication started to attract particular attention ( c . f . koole & ten thije 1994 ) . it has become clear that research into intercultural communication should take an interdisciplinary perspective and requires reflection on traditional linguistic categories of linguistic description in order to see which new discursive forms are facilitated by intercultural communication . the specific question to be adressed in this workshop is whether the linguistic involvement in intercultural research has resulted in the extension and enhancement of new linguistic categories and research methods . reflexion on this issue should focus on topics like procedures of assertaining understanding ( verstdndnissicherung ) ( c . f . metacommunication ) , pragmatic universals ( c . f . politeness ) , contrastive analyses of speech actions and texts , linguistic forms of perspectivity or culture comparison . references ehlich , k .

<subject> re : 8 . 764 , disc : noam chomsky : a life of dissent </subject> i read robert f . barsky 's reply to postal 's and pullum 's comments about feargul murphy 's review of his ( barsky 's ) book and found it odd , to say the least . about three quarters of barsky 's reply do ( does ? ) not deal with the postal - pullum comments about murphy 's review for the linguist but with a review by pullum for ' nature ' of barsky 's book . i can understand that barsky feels the need to defend himself against pullum ( who would n't ) , but most of what he says is simply irrelevant to the issue at hand . postal & pullum wrote a reply to murphy , not to barsky . but even granting that this was a welcome opportunity for barsky to reply to pullum 's ' nature ' review , i see no justification for the fact that this reply deals almost exclusively with chomsky 's non-linguistic activities , which were not at issue in p&p 's reply to murphy . p&p are concerned with what they take to be inaccuracies being spread by murphy ( and barsky ) about one specific issue : the politics of the mit linguistics department at a certain point in history . p&p mention chomsky 's non-academic political activities only very briefly , and only insofar as they are relevant to chomsky the linguist : they concern murphy 's strangely irrelevant remark that " chomsky was at this time simply very busy with other issues like the vietnam war " . ( i can only understand this remark , which is quoted by p&p as paraphrasing barsky , as insinuating that one ought not criticize chomsky 's academic politics because from someone who has the courage to speak out against the vietnam war anything goes ) . the following comment by barsky summarizes for me the tone and tenor of his entire reply : " pullum seems to want to tell all of us what to do and how to think . " this is not an argument , it 's low-level denigration . it reminds me of presidential debates . to quote barsky : " this is extremely unnerving .

" , so i will use " yes " ( the present tense is ok ) and " no " ( not ok ) . note that some linguists answered all questions , while the others did not . the numerals show the number of the linguists who have had the opinion . as for ( 5 ) , ( 6 ) , ( 17 ) and ( 18 ) , i will just write down the opinions . ( 1 ) a . they thought oxford was / is in london . ( yes 1 ; no 5 ; was is better 1 ) b . they thought oxford university was / is in london . ( yes 1 ; no 4 ; was is better 1 ) c . they thought oxford street was / is in london . ( yes 1 ; no 4 ; was is better 1 ) ( 2 ) a . john said mary was / is a liar .

( yes 3 ; no 2 ; ? ? 1 ; past is a little better 1 ) ( 5 ) in ( 2 ) - ( 4 ) above , you must have found some examples where the complement clause can have a present tense . is your judgment still the same if we put " always " in the main clause ? [ yes - 2 ] [ no ] [ less acceptable - 2 ] [ the present tense is acceptable with all but ( 3 ) ] [ a little odder ] a linguist has made an example where the present tense is ok : ( i ) john always told me that mary has her head in the clouds , and now i think he 's right . ( 6 ) in ( 2 ) - ( 4 ) above , you have found other examples where the complement clause can accept only a past tense . what will happen if we change the situation in the complement clause to " someone be lying , " e . g . she is lying ? or " someone be still lying " ? is the present tense ok in such a case ? [ no - 5 ] [ only in ( 2 ) ] [ ok in all but ( 3 ) ] ( 7 ) a . i thought scotlant was / is too far . ( yes 2 ; no 5 ; odd 1 ; past is better 1 ) b . scotland , i thought , was / is too far .

( yes 4 ; no 2 ; ? ? 1 ) ( 17 ) in ( 13 ) - ( 16 ) above , we have found some examples where the complement clause can accept only a past tense . what will happen if we put " still " in the complement clause ? is the pressent tense ok ? [ the present tense is not ok - 6 ] [ only for 3rd person ] [ " still " introduces a duration - some present tense is ok ] ( 18 ) in ( 13 ) - ( 16 ) above , the speaker is addressing to the hearer directly . are your judgments still the same if we change the situations like this : the speaker is talking on the phone to the hearer , who is in a distant place ? [ the same ] [ no - 2 ] [ yes for ( 13a ) and ( 14a ) - 2 ] [ for some of them the present would be possibly acceptable ] a linguist points out that for ( 13a ) and ( 14a ) to be ok , there should be some ill feeling between the participants , e . g . the hearer will be angered or surprised by the presence of the speaker . sorry for anything which might have been missed out . i will present a paper at the 114th meeting of the linguistic society of japan to be held at gakushuin university , tokyo , japan , on june 15 . i will take some of these results into consideration . others will contribute my future research immensely . i would like to thank again those who have helped me in various ways . minako nakayasu assistant professor kagoshima women 's college 1904 uchi hayato - cho , aira - gun , kagoshima 899-51 japan nakayasu @ kwc-u . ac . jp
<subject> new uci dissertation in linguistics </subject> irvine linguistics students association is pleased to announce the publication of the following uci dissertation in linguistics . overt movement as a reflex of morphology hajime ikawa under the framework of the minimalist program , this thesis answers fundamental questions with overt movement such as ( i ) what forces its application , and ( ii ) what is responsible for its presence / absence in languages . chapter 1 raises the above-mentioned fundamental questions with overt movement . it is shown that the current minimalist framework , as it is , does not explain any of them in a principled way . chapter 2 introduces two major operations assumed by the minimalist program , merge and move . chapter 3 first undertakes to identify the cause of overt movement in a way consistent with the basic minimalist assumption that any application of overt movement , as a departure from the best case , should be forced from the outside of the core computational system . it is claimed that overt movement is directly driven by the module morphology , which applies right after spell - out ; overt movement , whether head-movement or xp - movement , is forced to apply to morphologically support the suffixal functional heads . this claim automatically leads to derive the absence of overt movement in consistently head-final languages like japanese from their word order . the proposed analysis not only provides principled answers for the fundamental questions with overt movement , but eliminates one of the most problematic aspects of the minimalist program , the strong / weak distinction among functional heads . chapter 4 discusses various implications and consequences of the proposed analysis for overt movement , phrase structure , the computational system , and typological variations . chapter 5 discusses overt np - raising as overt movement indirectly driven by the morphological properties of agr . it is claimed that a subject in nominative-accusative languages overtly raises not to directly support agr , but to provide f-features for agr so that it can be successfully suffixed to a verb as the overt realization of the f-features of an np . from this , asymmetries between overt np - raising and other overt movements directly driven by morphology naturally follow . also available : > uci dissertations in linguistics griffith , teresa a . 1996 projecting transitivity and agreement takano , yuji 1996 movement and parametric variation in syntax zoerner , cyril edward 1995 coordination : the syntax of &p us $ 14 each , plus shipping and handling > uci working papers in linguistics , volume 3 ( 1997 ) . edited by luther > chen - sheng liu and kazue takeda articles appearing in the third volume are : brian agbayani : category raising , adjunction , and minimality lisa lai - shen cheng : " partial " wh - movement naoki fukui : attract and the a - over - a principle toru ishii : the " crossing " constraint and the minimal link condition luther chen - sheng liu : light verb and accusative - ing gerund in taiwanese yuji takano : object shift as short scrambling kazue takeda : a note on locality of category movement and feature movement sze - wing tang : the parametric approach to the resultative construction in chinese and english miyoko yashui : identification of ellipses and other empty categories us $ 14 , plus shipping and handling > uci working papers in linguistics , volume 2 : proceedings of the south > western optimality theory workshop ( swot ii ) . edited by brian agbayani > and naomi harada us $ 12 , plus shipping and handling > uci working papers in linguistics , volume 1 . edited by brian agbayani , > kazue takeda and sze - wing tang us $ 12 , plus shipping and handling shipping and handling ( per item ) domestic : $ 5 ;

<subject> grammar in schools </subject> i 'd like to second herb stahlke 's plea , following his brief survey of the decline in grammar teaching ( which mirrors the events in uk ) . > i also teach an undergrad english linguistics course that , for many > students , is the only brush with grammar in the entire english ed . > program . i find that these students , many of them well prepared and > highly motivated , have had little or no grammar in k12 . this is not > surprising , since they were taught by teachers who were taught to > believe that the teaching of grammar served no purpose . if they were > taught it at all , little effort was made to make grammar make sense or > seem relevant and interesting . they will become teachers with > probablly less understanding of and ability to teach grammar than even > the generation before them . > > how do we reverse this ? certainly not by either replacing grammar > with even more abstract and difficulty linguistic subject matter . > we ' re not going to see change without concerted efforts by linguists > to work together with educators , school boards and legislators to make > people aware of the nature of grammar as an academic subject . the lsa > has a standing committee on this topic , but i havent ' been able to > find out much about their activities or positions from the lsa > literature or web page . we have the responsibility and the knowledge > to bring about change in grammar education , but we do n't have any sort > of unified , concerted effort to do so . the same posting also carried a similar message from larry rosenwald , who describes his attempts to help students to write better : > what i do care about is having a > reasonably precise vocabulary for analysis . since this strand arose out of a discussion of a recent trial in uk of some materials for testing pupils ' knowledge of grammar , readers may be interested in the background . recent developments in uk are interesting and ( to my mind ) potentially very positive , in spite of having been introduced for quite the wrong reasons ( by a right-wing government aiming at a return to ` basics ' ) . the official national curriculum requires * all * schools to teach grammar . the most obvious statement of this requirement is under the heading ` writing ' for secondary schools ( specifically , leading up to ages 14 and 16 ) : ` pupils should be encouraged broaden their understanding of the principles of sentence grammar and be taught to organise whole texts effectively . [ note the stress on understanding grammar as well as on applying this understanding . ] pupils should be given opportunities to analyse their own writing , reflecting on the meaning and clarity of individual sentences , using appropriate terminology , and so be given opportunities to learn about : - discourse structure - the structure of whole texts - paragraph structure ; how different types of praragraphs are formed ; openings and closings in different kinds of writing ; - phrase , clause and sentence structure - the use of complex grammatical structures and the linking of structures through appropriate connective ; the use of main and subordinate clauses and phrases ; - words - components including stem , prefix , suffix , inflection ; grammatical functions of nouns , verbs , adjectives , adverbs , pronouns , prepositions , conjunctions and demonstratives ; - punctuation - the use of the full range of punctuation marks , including full stops , question and exclamation marks , commas , semi-colons , colons , . . ' as a linguist i have very few arguments with this list ( given its purpose etc ) . it 's also recognised that teachers themselves need to be trained to do this kind of work . but it 's rather ambitious , and the teachers ( and teacher-trainers ) need help from the professionals - i . e . us . i think a lot of us in the uk would be interested to hear from colleagues in other countries where school grammar is fed more directly by academic grammar . = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = richard ( = dick ) hudson department of phonetics and linguistics , university college london , gower street , london wc1e 6bt work phone : + 171 419 3152 ; work fax : + 171 383 4108 email : dick @ ling . ucl . ac . uk web-sites : home page = http : / / www . phon . ucl . ac . uk / home / dick / home . htm unpublished papers available by ftp = . . . . uk / home / dick / papers . htm
<subject> sum : particle movement </subject> dear linguist listers , about a month ago i posted a query regarding literature on ' particle movement ' in english or , to be more precise , literature on factors contributing to the position of the particle in transitive phrasal-verb constructions such as ( 1 ) a . john brought back the book . b . john brought the book back . in the beginning , i 'd like to thank very much all of those who responded and shared their knowledge with me . apart from some very valuable hints i even received offers to send me unpublished papers or to share the up to now unpublished results of recent research concerning the topic in question . additionally , some answers were suggestions concerning methodological matters or exceptions from the rules generally cited . now that i have managed to mail my answers to all of them individually ( my sincere apologies to those who had had to wait unexpectedly long for their answers ) i want to post the summary of all those who contributed to my research followed by their suggestions or references ( in alphabetical order ) : - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - aarts , bas ( b . aarts @ ucl . ak . uk ) : dear stefan gries , regarding your query on linguist , you may want to have a look at a paper of mine in the journal of linguistics , 25 . 2 , 1989 , 277-290 : ` verb - preposition constructions and small clauses in english ' ( and references cited there ) . this article also appears in modified form in my book _ small clauses in english : the nonverbal types _ . new york and berlin : mouton de gruyter . 1992 . hope this is helpful . bas aarts cameron , richard ( rcameron @ uic . edu ) for an article which investigates " the factors contributing to the position of the particle " , see : kroch , anthony and cathy small . 1978 . grammatical ideology and its effect on speech . in david sankoff ( ed . ) linguistic variation : models and methods . new york : academic press . pp . 45-55 . good luck . richard cameron durham . linguistics @ durham . ac . uk ( durham linguistics ) you might like to look at : johnson , k . 1991 . object positions . _ natural language and linguistic theory _ 9 : 577-636 . fischer , susan ( currently : fischer @ sal . tohoku . ac . jp ) i did my 1971 - 2 mit dissertation on the acquisition of verb-particle constructions as well as double-object constructions in english . i do not have a copy of my dissertation ( the acquisition of verb - particle and dative constructions ) with me here on sabbatical , but the main point of the structure chapter was that unstressed pronoun direct objects are cliticized to the verb - - so you must say " i gave it up " rather than " i gave up it " . however , if the pronoun has inherent or contrastive stress , the particle can intervene between the verb and the object : " ok i gave up that a long time ago " , " i gave up him , he did n't give up me . " good luck with your work . susan fischer foster , joseph f . ( joseph . foster @ uc . edu ) mr . gries , re your query on linguist re bring np back and structures of that ilk , i believe chomsky actually used this as one of his examples motivating transformations in syntactic structures . nelson francis also did in his structure of american english which was basically an immediate constituent analysis a la rulon wells . my chief reason for returning your signal however is to let you know if you do n't already ( as your signal suggests you may not ) that there is certainly a dialect of english in which the particle must always follow a pronoun direct object . thus your ( 2 ) b * * * john picked up him . is never grammatical in my english ( i speak natively ozark english but am fluent in standard southern american and pretty fair in midwestern . ) even if the him be contrastively stressed , it can never follow the particle . on the other hand , your 1 a and b are both ok . joe foster fraser , bruce ( bfraser @ bu . edu ) if you get any answers to your query , i would appreciate learning of the article . good luck . bruce fraser hagstrom ( hagstrom @ scf . usc . edu ) try hawkins ' " performance theory of order and constituency " cambridge university press 1994 for a processing approach to word order . cynthia hawkins , john ( hawkins @ almaak . usc . edu ) hi stefan : i saw your question on the linguist list re particle positioning . i have quite a bit of discussion on the ordering of verb , particle and np in my 1994 book a performance theory of order and constituency , cup , pp . 180-182 , and also some textual data . in the meantime i have collected a whole bunch more data , and have examined the constituent structure of v-np - part sequences in greater detail , and have found ordering evidence for two quite distinct structures here : one i analyze as a predication structure in which the part is semantically a predication ( e . g . lift the child up = the child is up ) ; one in which it is not and which i analyze as a discontinuous verb-particle structure ( look the number up does not equal the number is up ) . the proposed constituency difference predicts different orderings in conjunction with the basic ordering principle of my book ( early immediate constituents ) . i have n't got this stuff written up yet , but i ' ll be happy to share it with you when i have . best wishes , john hawkins kemmer , suzanne e . ( kemmer @ ruf . rice . edu ) i ' m happy to hear you ' re going to work on english particles . i do n't have any references to give you , only a suggestion : the generative work on particles was not very empirical , and never actually looked at the distribution of the verb adjacent vs . the postnominal particle . the distribution is highly lexically governed . ( for example , i have many times heard ' look over it ' instead of ' look it over ' , although all the generative literature assumes only ' look it over ' , because of the pronoun . the fact is , ' look over ' is coalescing into a single unit that overrides the pronoun-first preference . ) so , my suggestion is , get yourself a concordance program and actually look at large samples of english . it 's true , it will be written data ( unless you have a spoken corpus ) , and as such more conservative and somewhat less open to the innovations people actually make ; but some real generalizations will emerge . you can search on the various particles ( throwing out the prepositional uses ) and get an idea of which verbs like which particles . ( if you need suggestions on inexpensive concordance programs , let me know ) good luck , suzanne mills , carl ( carl . mills @ uc . edu ) at the 21st forum of the linguistic association of canada and the united states ( lacus ) , i presented a paper entitled " ' obligatory particle movement ' in english , " which is available on pp . 195-204 of the papers from the 21st lacus forum , ed . by mava jo powell . i wrote the paper because i had come across several examples in normal english conversation that violated your starred example : ( 2 ) a . john picked him up . b . * john picked up him . because these were examples that i overheard , some on national public radio , i knew that your stipulation " ( 2b ) is starred unless ' him ' is contrastively stressed " did not hold : the pronoun around which the particle was supposed to have been " moved " was not contrastively stressed . within a matter of days , i overheard three sentences : he wanted to help out them . he went in the house and put down something . can you ring up this ? i added 21 more sentences , some that i made up and some that had been starred in various linguistics publications , and conducted an acceptability judgment survey using a written questionnaire . statistically , the results indicated that speakers accept the sort of rule that underlies your starring of ( 2b ) above , but they do n't always obey the rule . there is more , but you can read the paper for that . good luck . carl mills nathan , geoff ( geoffn @ siu . edu ) dear stefan , a number of years ago we had a student work on this problem , and she wrote a thesis using an early version of cognitive grammar . she finished her thesis , and unfortunately dropped out of linguistics - - i do n't even know where she is now . but i could send you a copy of her thesis if that would be of use to you . best , geoff nathan nolan , brian ( bnolan @ iol . ie ) you may find what you need in the works of talmy , listed below . talmy explores the windowing of attention and the linguistic correlates which pertain to this phenonema . he explains how we can bring to attention , or focus , certain features in a dialogue and how these can manifest themselves linguistically via foregrounding and backgrounding , gapping etc . , etc . talmy 's ( 1996a ) , or his ( 1985 ) work is probably a good place to start talmy , leonard .

" the book back " would be a small clause , in your example ) and relates particle shift to heavy np shift ; the particle moves to the right when it is phonologically " heavy " . i adopted the small clause configuration from kayne but criticized the heavy np shift approach to the word order variation in a 1992 article , and proposed a technical syntactic solution for particle shift ( based on the particle " incorporating " into the verb ) . den dikken , in his 1992 dissertation ( later published as den dikken 1995 ) agreed with my rejection of kayne 's analysis but tendered some accurate criticism of my approach , and offered a different syntatic analysis , which also adopts the small clause structure but which in which shift is characterized as np movement across the particle for case reasons . in my 1994 dissertation , i accept den dikken 's criticism of my 1992 analysis but show some evidence that the base structure he assumes is incorrect . i propose another syntactic account based on two alternative movements ; either the particle moves or the np moves . in later work i have developed this approach and extended it to the scandinavian languages . i have one article published in 1996 in working papers in scandinavian syntax and a longer one that has n't been published anywhere ( yet ! ) . i also have a review of den dikken 's book published in the journal language . two additional recent references are johnson 's 1991 ( ? ) article in natural language and linguistic theory , in which the verb plus particle start out as a constituent , and the verb moves from the particle ( as in most analyses of german and dutch ) , and collins & thrainsson 's 1996 linguistic inquiry article , in which the particle first moves up to attach to the verb , as in my 1992 article , and then the verb moves away , as in johnson . all of the above works deal to some extent with the basic pattern of shift , which is that pronouns precede the particle and modified particles ( and particles with complements ) follow the noun phrase - - with greater or lesser degrees of success . for example , pronouns are often considered to have special properties with respect to case , and this has been exploited in several of the above works . in my dissertation , i speculate somewhat inconclusively that the special positioning of pronouns may be due to their prosodic lightness , and i expand on that possibility in the wpss article , where i show that destressed nps are best before the particle , while stressed nps are better after the particle , e . g . ( 1 ) how with the girls get here ? a . i ' ll pick the girls up b . * i ' ll pick up the girls c . i ' ll pick up the girls ( 2 ) who will you pick up ? a . i ' ll pick up the girls b . * i ' ll pick the girls up c . i ' ll pick the girls up in each case , the ( a ) example is best , because the natural right-edge pitch increase coincides with an element that is not old information . the ( b ) examples are bad because salient old information should not be stressed . the ( c ) examples are acceptable , because sentence stress does n't fall on the old information , but are less good than the ( a ) examples , because the stress has been shifted away from the right edge of the sentence . in the article i provide a technical formal account of this fact . the same kind of account might extend to the pronouns and modified particles , but some more work is needed , since examples with particle before pronoun or modified particle after np are worse than the ( c ) examples above , even with stress shift to the left . however , the fact that stress on a pronoun ( or coordination of pronouns , which also makes them phonologically heavy ) allow it to follow the particle suggests a prosodic account . i realize this has been rather breezy , but it 's because i do n't know how much of it really is of interest to you . if you me to expand on something , just ask . if you want more complete references , or if you would like me to send any of my own papers , i 'd be happy to oblige . best , peter svenonius - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - again , thanks very much to all of you stefan th . gries
<subject> 8 . 859 , disc : punctuation </subject> john phillips ( 8 . 859 ) asks , with respect to apostrophised plurals , e . g . " dyslexic 's " , " sonata 's " , < < exactly what are the grounds for condemning this usage ? > > one of the joys of linguistlist is that only here could such a question be asked , and from an academic address . it was , i think , benji wald who perceptively remarked , in the ebonics debate , that linguists , and only linguists , believe in the equal value of all language forms . perhaps i might widen the question to " what are the grounds for condemning particular variations in human symbolic behaviour ( vocabulary , accent , spelling , non - si units , facial hair , clothes , tied or untied laces ) ? " alas , the answer is not universalistic , and comes down to one of two tyrannical reasons : because it ' ll harm your job prospects ; and , even more tyrannical : because your peers will make fun of you . it depends on who you take as your reference group ( " whom " for american readers ) , and how much you feel like a fight . a lot of academic linguists are in fact not neutral on this issue - - they want a sort of compensatory justice for the usage of disadvantaged groups , " threatened languages " like their biologist colleagues ' " threatened species " . ( there are , of course , self-serving as well as moral reasons for this . ) and this may go some way to explain the gulf of incomprehension between them and other people . it is hard to find common ground between those who believe in " bettering oneself " and those who think this invidious rubbish . roger depledge freelance translator toulouse

<subject> " circumcision " in african languages </subject> 13 june 1997 linguist - l and arcling subscribers , towards the end of last year i requested assistance in finding terms for " circumcision " in african languages . the paper that resulted from that query and related work is now in press as " aspects of male circumcision in subequatorial african culture history " in _ health transition review _ . the paper is available through the health transition centre web site : http : / / www-nceph . anu . edu . au / htc / htr . htm ( then " find " " marck " ) the main text is in rft format and seems to be readable by most word processing softwares . there are five maps which are in " pdf " format and can be read with the freeware " acrobat reader " for which a link is provided after the title of the paper . the main conclusions were suggestive rather than diagnostic and i was able to make no higher level reconstructions than vansina 's western bantu reconstructions . but a strong typological argument emerged suggesting that bantu speaking peoples who do not practice male circumcision have abandoned a former practice and it was noted that the bantu speaking peoples who have done so are contiguous guthrie groups . along with abandonment of male circumcision , these groups have also abandoned male adolescent rites of initiation and age grades except on some of the margins of the non-circumcising area . the purpose of the project was to ask what male circumcision means to africans and why it has the distribution it does as circumcising groups in africa have consistently lower hiv rates ( i work in the third world unit of an epidemiology centre ) . thanks to those people who offered information or encouragement . jeff marck linguistics - rspas and _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ jeff marck health transition review ( htr ) publications officer health transition centre ( htc ) jeff . marck @ anu . edu . au national centre for epidemiology 61 - 6-249 - 5626 and population health ( nceph ) 61 - 6-249 - 5614 ( fax ) australian national university ( anu ) canberra act 0200 australia nceph : http : / / www-nceph . anu . edu . au htc : http : / / www-nceph . anu . edu . au / htc . htm htc publications : http : / / www-nceph . anu . edu . au / htc / htcpub . htm health transition review ( journal ) health transition series ( books ) bibliographies and other links personal homepage : http : / / coombs . anu . edu . au / ~ marck / marck . htm austronesian on - line : http : / / coombs . anu . edu . au / ~ marck / anhmpg . htm european society for oceanists australian mirror site : http : / / coombs . anu . edu . au / ~ marck / esfo / esfo . htm _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _

' quasi ' refers to an unreal world in any case ( for the speaker ) , which can be real for the subject , in some cases . so i wonder whether this may be the difference also between ' as if / as though ' . i have found only few word on this matter in j . haimann ( 1974 ) , ' foundations of language ' 11 , p . 353 : " in at least one construction , there is no difference , even aspectual , between the conjunctions ' if ' and ' though ' : max spends money as ( if , though ) it was going out of style i have also asked some native speakers , but no one perceives any difference . the only one who feels that it is possible that they differ ( but he is not sure of it ) is i . sag . he wrote to me that ' as though ' seems to be more counterfactual than ' as if ' . so horn suspension would give : he speaks as if he were in charge , and in fact he is ? he speaks as though he were in charge , and in fact he is but , to say it with haimann , complete mystery surrounds the nature of this construction . so , if you get more certain judgements and if there are references , please , let me know . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - thanks again for the contributions and i ' ll let you know of further progress . ken sugayama kensei sugayama dept of english kobe city univ . of foreign studies department of linguistics university of manchester e-mail : xj9k-sgym @ j . asahi-net . or . jp e-mail : k . sugayama @ stud . man . ac . uk

<subject> new service for linguist subscribers </subject> dear subscribers : the linguist list has just instituted a new service , which we ' re calling " the notice board . " the notice board can be found at : http : / / linguistlist . org / ~ notice / it is intended to help linguists make professional contacts and find practical information - - the kind of information that facilitates our professional activities but is not directly related to linguistic research . for example , you might post a notice on the notice board if : - you ' re spending your sabbatical in another city and want to find a house to rent - you need crash space or a roommate for a linguistics conference . - you want information about living conditions in a region where you ' ll be doing fieldwork . this is the kind of information-gathering that used to be one of the great advantages of email distribution lists . and , having benefited from it ourselves in the past , we have often regretted that the size of linguist 's subscriber list ( now over 9000 ) makes it impossible to post such inquiries in linguist issues . we hope that this " linguist notice board " on the world wide web will partly take the place of such postings . we will , of course , continue to post queries having to do with linguistic research and announcements of general interest ( jobs , fellowships , conferences , etc . ) on linguist . so you should continue to send these to the list . the notice board is designed for more personal requests and announcements ( but not " lonely linguist seeks attractive , adventurous informant . . . " the notice board won't be quite that personal . . . . ) please let us know if you have suggestions for its improvement . helen , anthony , daniel linguist moderators reminders : 1 ) linguist dissertation abstracts are now searchable . if you have n't yet entered your dissetation abstract , please do so at : http : / / linguistlist . org / dissop . html ( if you do n't have web access , send us an email message and we will be happy to enter your information for you . ) 2 ) linguist is in the process of creating a searchable directory of linguists . if you have n't done so , please enter informaion about yourself at : http : / / linguistlist . org / persop . html thanks !

<subject> disc : grammar in uk schools </subject> forwarded message - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - i have recently received , by a rather roundabout route , just a few of the contributions to this discussion . i do n't , therefore , know everything that has been said . i teach advanced level english language ( as well as a separate course in english literature ) at a sixth form college - i . e . to students aged 16 + . they come to us from 80 + different schools , so have a wide range of previous educational experience . far from arriving having been taught to avoid splitting infinitives and ending sentences with prepositions , most arrive having never been taught what infinitives and prepositions are . they lack the ` reasonably precise vocabulary for analysis ' referred to by larry rosenwald in his contribution of 5 june . i can teach them the terminology from scratch , but find that it does not ` bed down ' as it would have done if they had been familiar with basic grammatical concepts from a much earlier age . a few days ago , i spent a whole lesson teaching my students to distinguish between active and passive verbs ( something which i myself could have done easily at the age of 12 , thanks to the ` old-fashioned ' grammar teaching which i received ) because i wanted them to try an old exam question where the knowledge would have helped them to see which of two texts would have been harder for young children to read . i ended up nursing them through the . exercise , doing much of the work for them . in the next lesson , i gave them another old exam question with extracts from ` animal farm ' to analyse in the light of orwell 's own suggestion ( amongst others ) that one should prefer the active to the passive . many of the students took so long to decide which verbs were active and which passive that they had no time to write an analysis . a recurring problem on the course is that students struggle with higher-order analysis because they lack lower-order skills . teachers in the past at least had the grace to teach children how to recognise infinitives and prepositions : they described before they prescribed or proscribed . now , however , most teachers seem so anxious to avoid prescription and proscription that they avoid even description . like larry rosenwald , i think that the prescriptivist / descriptivist dichotomy has been taken too far . jennifer chew - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - end of forwarded message - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

<subject> summary on anglicization of names </subject> hi - i posted a query a while ago about how non - english names get anglicized . what i got in response was quite interesting , though most of it was anecdotal , as the responders themselves noted . most of the research cited was not in sociolinguistics but in speech technology . i still think this would be an interesting topic to work on . in any case , i ' m including the responses i got , with thanks to all and apologies for the typographical irregularities - best , larry rosenwald , wellesley college 1 ) > from margaret luebs < maluebs @ umich . edu > i saw your message on the linguist list and wanted to share a story with you ( probably not scholarly enough for your summary , though ) . my last name is german and is spelled " luebs " . people always assume it is pronounced " lubes " which is pretty close to the expected german pronunciation ( though that may not have been how my great-grandparents said it ; see below ) . instead , irritatingly enough , we say " lebbs " . the story i ' ve been told ( which may be partly apocryphal ) is that when my grandfather ( the first of 12 siblings to make it off the farm that their parents settled on in the 1880 's ) arrived at the university of nebraska in 1910 , he went to a professor in the german department and asked " what is the american pronunciation of my name ? " ( because up till then his family had just pronounced it the old way - - they spoke german at home and lived among lots of other germans ) . the professor , for some reason , said " lebbs " so that 's what we got stuck with . then a few years later another brother made it to the university , and * he * went to a * different * professor in the german department and asked the same question . the answer he got was " leebs " so that 's how his descendants pronounce the name . other cousins seem to have just used their own common sense , because there are some out there who pronounce it " lubes " . however we have an old letter from germany addressed to my great-grandfather , and it refers to him as " h . libs " , ( a misspelling perhaps inspired by the actual pronunciation ) so the original pronunciation may have been closer to " leebs " . it still does n't explain " lebbs " , but oh well . i know this is n't what you asked for - - it 's not phonetic factors or even normal sociolinguistic ones , but rather the dreaded influence of university professors ! 2 ) > from lexo @ lsi . sel . sony . com ( lex olorenshaw ) hi , the anglicization topic interests me , too , but more from a speech technology point of view . for example , what ways can we anticipate the anglicized pronunciation of names in order to produce better synthesized speech , or to automatically recognize speech better ? some research has been done in this area for text - to - speech synthesizers . but i have n't looked into it too much . there are a couple of references to " name pronunciation " on this web site that might serve as a starting point - http : / / www . bellcore . com / orator / oref . html since i ' ve been wondering about this , i also did a quick search for " name pronunciation " in linguistics abstract online ( currently on a free trial basis ! ) , and came up with the following items - - - - - - - - - - - title : variant grapheme-phoneme correspondences in unfamiliar polysyllabic words author : robert l . trammell journal : language and speech vol : 33 ( 4 ) , 1990 , 293-323 subdiscipline : phonology abstract : ten college students and ten phds read aloud 30 unfamiliar english words , two to five syllables in length , of greek , latin , and germanic origin . the average number of different subject pronunciations per word was five ( range one to ten ) . each response was compared to the rule-predicted , dictionary-prescribed , and most frequent pronunciation for that word . the subjects agreed more with each other than with the dictionary , and with the latter more than with the rules . however , the rules predicted half of the prescribed pronunciations , which was better than the average number of individual subject ` s responses agreeing with the dictionary . the most frequent response to each word demonstrated considerably more agreement with both the dictionary and the rules than did the average number of responses for the subjects individually . the etymological source of the test words had no effect . while the phds as a group did significantly better than the students on most measures , the differences were small . in view of previous research , the frequent vowel laxing in open third and fourth syllables from the end was unexpected . several models of reading are examined in the light of these results . - - - - - - - - - title : novel - word pronunciation : a cross-language study author : k . p . h sullivan & r . i . damper journal : speech communication vol : 13 ( 3 - 4 ) , 1993 , 441-452 subdiscipline : computational linguistics abstract : in the case of a ' novel word ' absent from a text-to - speech system ` s pronouncing dictionary , traditional systems invoke context-dependent letter-to - phoneme rules to produce a pronunciation . a proposal in the psychological literature , however , is that human readers pronounce novel words not by using explicit rules , but by analogy with letter-to - phoneme patterns for words they already know . in this paper , a synthesis-by - analogy system is presented which is , accordingly , also a model of novel-word pronunciation by humans . it employs analogy in both orthographic and phonological domains and is applied here to the pronunciation of novel words in british ( received pronunciation ) english and german . in implementing the system , certain detailed questions were confronted which analogy theory is at present inadequately developed to answer . thus , a major part of this work concerns the impact of implementational choices on performance , where this is defined as the ability of the system to produce pronunciations in line with those given by humans . the size and content of the lexical database on which any analogy system must be based are also considered . the better performing implementations produced useful results for both british english and german . however , best results for each of the two languages were obtained from rather different implementations . authors of abstract : authors - - - - - - - - - - - 3 )

and tone delimited the sentences . the synthetic elements that still characterize many languages started but as analytic elements . for example , the b - past tense prefix in basque began life as a a simple adverb , ba , meaning " already " , and before that , simply " over " . the ie e-augment for non-concommitant verbal forms started out as simply the adverb * e , " then " , and before that " there ( 3rd p . deixis ) " . the formant - i / y , which forms adjectives in so many languages , was first the noun " word " , which acquired the meaning " like " . many languages like ie have factitive forms that are simply - - at origin - - combinations of the verb stem and an element meant " it " , in ie yo . the aa second person singular - k is simply a word for " male " . with this history behind us , it is difficult to believe that constructions like " have done " will not , at some some future , develop into v-prefix perfects . nietzsche , of course , said it far more eloquently , but the modern phrase " what goes around , comes around " expresses it quite well also . language , like all of existence , is not unidirectional . it has a direction only in the same sense that a very small segment of a circle appears to be straight . what really separates " primitive " languages from advanced ones , is the insistence of nominative-type ( g . a . klimov ) languages on an overtly expressed transitive subject . the mindset that this produces is directly responsible for the scientific approach that has resulted in the technology of the late 20th century . however we may wish to theorize , it is a fact that the scientific advances that have us all in a state of perpetual uneasiness , have come about through scientists who speak nominative-type languages , or who got their training in nominative-type languages . science is simply a matter of correctly linking cause and effect . nominative - type language are used to organizing their thoughts by reflex into a cause and effect algorithm . that is not to say that speakers of other languages cannot organize their thoughts logically . but logic and what constitutes a logical approach is culturally determined . factors that nt - speakers would reject as not directly causal would be difficult to eradicate from the " logic " of thinkers in other non - nt - speaking cultural matrices . the single advantage that synthetic languages have is freer word order , which can be economically employed for emphasizing or topicalizing selected elements of the sentence . but every analytic language with rigid word order has other devices to accomplish the same purpose . pat - patrick c . ryan < proto-language @ worldnet . att . net > ( 501 ) 227-9947 ;

<subject> workshop on complexity in language contact , acquisition and change </subject> newsletter 1 . workshop on complexity in language contact , acquisition and change . 8 september 1998 , paris , france . in colaboration with the cnrs ( centre national de recherche scientifique ) , the lot ( netherlands graduate school of linguistics ) is organizing some workshops to create a forum to encourage the discussion between researchers in linguistics from the netherlands and france . one of the workshops is initiated by members of the university of amsterdam and has as its subject : complexity in language contact , acquisition and change . the workshop will take place on tuesday the 8th of september , starting at 14 . 30 until approximately 20 . 00h . the theme although there is a kind of dogma that all natural languages are equally complex , at least for certain subsystems of language there may well be differences in complexity . in discussions of processes of language change and first and second language acquisition the notion of complexity plays an important role . especially in creole studies simplicity and complexity implicitly have been dominant issues in the debate , but are seldom properly scrutinized . in this workshop we want to discuss the role of complexity in these domains , including grammatical theory , first and second language acquisition , language change and language contact - in order to shed light on controversial problems invoked by the term complexity in linguistics in general . the structure of the workshop the workshop is organized around three themes : creole languages , language acquisition and language change . each theme will be discussed by researchers from france and the netherlands in 10 minutes presentations , inspired by the following propositions . after these short presentations there will be time for discussion in each session . 1 . all languages have the same " costs / payment " balance , i . e . if a language becomes phonologically more simple , its morphological system will become more complex . [ cf . haugen 1976 : 286 ] 2 . all complexity in languages resides in the lexicon . [ cf . aronoff 1995 ] 3 . languages spoken within small communities are more complex than languages of large communities . [ cf . whinnom 1980 , hymes 1971 , mhlhusler 1996 ] 4 . language shift will in general lead to simplification , while borrowing will lead generally to more complex structures . [ cf . thomason & kaufman 1988 ] 5 . complexity does not play a role in first language acquisition , but it does in second language acquisition . [ cf . trudgill 1992 ] 6 . grammaticalization leads to greater complexity .

<subject> tanlps workshop : final call for paper </subject> tanlps workshop : final call for papers held at the european conference on machine learning ( ecml ' 98 ) , chemnitz , germany 21-24 april 1998 ( www address : http : / / www . tu-chemnitz . de / informatik / ecml98 / ) . tanlps towards adaptive nlp - driven systems : linguistic information , learning methods and applications 24 april 1998 organized by : r . basili , m . t . pazienza ( university of roma , tor vergata , italy ) since most of its applications , from syntactic to semantic , are lexicon driven , systematic and reliable acquisition on a large scale of linguistic information is the real challenge to natural language processing ( nlp ) . empiricist view on natural language processing and learning has become recently more attractive for a wider research community : computational linguistics , artificial intelligence , psychology then seemed to converge on a specific data-oriented perspective aiming to overcome the traditional knowledge acquisition bottleneck . it has been often noted that the limited attention paid by the machine learning community to text and speech data seems unjustified . it is thus more and more evident that empirical learning of natural language processing ( nlp ) can alleviate the nlp main problem by means of a variety of methods for the automatic induction of lexical knowledge . lexical knowledge is often hard to compile by hand , and even harder to port and reuse . nlp application systems still have a low impact on real world problems , mainly due to the costs related to reusability and customization of the required lexicons . in particular , changes in the domain causes changes in the lexical information required in the underlying natural language . empirical , symbolic machine learning methods can be perfectly suited for this task like automatic acquisition and adaptation of this knowledge . rule induction , symbolic approaches to clustering , lazy learning , and inductive logic programming , have been already proposed by a growing community that is entering the challenge for theoretical ( i . e . methodological ) and application purposes a variety of techniques seems to be combined in order to successfully design realistic inductive systems for text processing : the target of this research is to define methods and design principles for systems combining linguistic and lexical learning capabilities for large scale language processing tasks . this is what we mean with adaptive nlp - driven systems . within this research task , some issues can favour a synergistic process between nlp and ml areas : the access to large data sets , that are even increasing over time , due to the telematics facilities available nowadays ; extending the set of typical classes of ml problems to other hard cases ( particularly dense in the nlp processes ) ; adding inductive capabilities to nlp system for tasks related to specific applications ( i . e . information extraction ) . the proposed workshop thus aims at stimulating reasearch and discussion on the following aspects : - establishing results and evidencies on the suitability of different ml paradigms on specific levels of representation of lexical knowledge ( morphology , syntax , linguistic inference among others ) - comparison of the quantitative approaches to lexical acquisition with empirical symbolic methods - stimulating discussion on cognitive perspective of some models within a plausible architecture for language processing and learning - establishing results on the applicability of the extracted / induce knowledge within nlp systems , with respect to assessed evaluation criteria , typical of the ml and language engineering ( le ) area - case studies on adaptive nlp systems , i . e . effective nlp systems integrating linguistic inferences with inductive capabilities ( www kb at cmu , ecran , . . . ) , - critical review of existing experiences on adaptive nlp systems - establishing guidelines for an evaluation framework of adaptive nlp systems : accuracy of the linguistic process , robustness of the induction process , . . . - promote cooperation among research groups in europe and usa to exchange ideas , data and tools for design and experiment architectures for adaptive nlp systems related events a parallel workshop will be also held in the ecml conference : " text mining " organized by yves kodratoff . although close in intent and topics , the two workshops have a specific " identity " in terms of area of research , multidisciplinary aspects and contributions . so , in order to enhance the discussion and the synergistic contributions to the two independent approaches , submissions covering common problems ( i . e . adaptive data mining from textual data ) will undergo a specific review , in cooperation with the other workshop pc . in fact , a joint ( half day ) session on specific borderline topics as well as on existing ( hybrid ) systems has been planned and a subset of the accepted papers will be presented there . a particular effort will be asked to authors for stressing / enhancing synergistic aspects . the program committee will suggest guidelines to compare / generalize / extend individual contributions in this specific perspective . workshop format : the workshop is expected to cover the whole day . in the first session , apart from an invited talk , we expect to cover methodological issues . papers related to advanced research on suitability of learning paradigms for the different target lexical information will be favoured . prototypical examples in this area are studies on empirical learning of tasks like pos tagging , induction of grammatical information , symbolic learning of word sense disambiguation criteria and lexical semantic information . a panel discussion is expected to close the morning session and focus on principles of suitability for learning paradigms vs . lexical levels . in the second session we expect to stimulate participants to cover application areas , like ir and ie , on original research works that are currently under development in several research centres in europe ( sheffield , tilburg , rome tor vergata and torino universities ) . a panel discussion on the implication of the adaptive paradigm on existing and potential nlp systems will close the workshop . program committee r . basili ( university of roma , tor vergata , italy ) m . craven ( carnegie mellon university , usa ) w . daelemans ( university of tilburg , nederlands ) m . t . pazienza ( university of roma , tor vergata , italy ) l . saitta ( university of torino , italy ) c . samuelssonn ( bell labs , at&t , usa ) y . wilks ( university of sheffield , uk ) paper submission : = = = = = = = = = = = = papers should not exceed 3000 words or 6 pages . hard copy submission : three copies of the paper should be sent to : roberto basili department of computer science , systems and production university of roma , tor vergata via di tor vergata 00133 roma ( italy ) e-mail : basili @ info . utovrm . it electronic submission : electronic submission may be in either self-contained postscript or rtf formats , to basili @ info . utovrm . it for each submission -

( 1998 ) . errors in language learning and use : exploring error analysis . london : longman . isbn 0 582 25763 - 8 ( paperback ) . rrp : 14 . 99 . the analysis of errors in cognitive , linguistic and other psychological processes has a long history dating back to the introduction of signal detection theory in psychophysics and behavioural learning paradigms . although many applied linguists now favour interlanguage paradigms for second-language acquisition , error analysis ( ea ) is still widely used in language classes . the attraction of ea lies in one 's ability to isolate variability in responses , such as distinguishing true errors from " mistakes " , which simple " correct / incorrect " paradigms tend to discard . in this new book on ea in language learning and usage , carl james builds on his earlier work on contrastive analysis and applied linguistics to further explore the role that performance errors play in language acquisition ( particularly second-language acquisition ) . the book consists of a historical overview of ea in applied linguistics , and then embarks on an ambitious attempt to both define and constrain the scope and methodology of ea in language processing and language learning . this methodology includes typologies for classifying and understanding how errors arise , as well as algorithmic specifications for the diagnosis and error correction in clinical and educational settings . the first chapter aims to give a historical overview of ea in the context of its origins , its inspirations , its competitors , and its influences on second language teaching . james defines an error as " an unsuccessful bit of language " ( p . 1 ) which seems to be as succinct and compact a description as i ' ve ever read ! however , this very readable style of writing , whilst appearing informal , is maintained through later chapters where discussion of technical issues could easily have been obfuscated by a poor writing style . first - and second-order paradigms within language learning are described in detail in this chapter , with the interlanguage and crosslinguistic approaches compared with alternatives such as ea and contrastive analysis . idiosyncratic and language-specific difficulties in language learnability are also covered in the context of linguistic change and metalinguistic influences on successful language acquisition . several methods for collecting data in ea are informally introduced in this chapter ( e . g . , error elicitations such as the " broad trawl " ) , which naturally leads into the second chapter on defining the scope of ea in language acquisition . the second chapter begins with an enlightening discussion of popular conceptions of what " proper " language is ( such as the king 's english ) , and catalogues the many failed attempts to enforce a " correct " dialect of english both in britain and asia ( the " complaints " tradition ) . this issue is clearly relevant for defining exactly what an error is , given the absolutist attributions made by some educators and policy makers about the tenability or correctness of certain forms of spoken and written english ( i . e . , " standard " english ) . james outlines some typologies for understanding language norms based on geographical and historical constraints , but correctly identifies deficiencies in these schemes ( particularly the failure , for example , to understand the role of colonialism in language preferences ) . this issue is taken up with respect to the issue of power and authority of native speakers with respect to non-native speakers of english , and conversely how the desire to speak a second language can unwittingly result in language loss and native - language change . chapters 3 , 4 and 5 focus on the definition and description of errors within the ea paradigm , having defined the focus of the ea methodology in the previous chapters . james begins by defining learners ' ignorance of a target language in terms of four categories of deviance : grammaticality , acceptability , correctness and strangeness . it is a clear advantage of the authors ' approach to ea that both grammatical / rational and performance / empirical approaches to language acquisition are covered by his typology , thus not " taking sides " with one viewpoint or the other . this rationale is based on the idea that ea is a methodology rather than a theoretical prescription . this focus continues with a discussion of error detection methods , in the context of locating and describing such errors in different parts of speech and indeed with respect to discourses longer than single sentences or phrases . the importance of a pluralistic approach which is tolerant of differences in dialects is emphasised , whilst ensuring that objective and stationary criteria are applied to utterances and writing within each dialect group . error taxonomies , such as feature and surface structure approaches , are outlined in detail with worked examples , which are one of the key design features of the authors ' pedagogical approach . computer - assisted analysis of errors is also discussed , as are specific algorithmic approaches to rating levels of error in lexical and grammatical processes . the next two chapters focus on diagnosing errors and evaluating their seriousness and impact for second-language learners in particular . possible negative influences , such as interlingual errors arising from conflicts between the target language and mother tongue , are treated in detail , as are intralingual errors and inconsistencies which the non-native speaker encounters for the first time in the target language , such as over-generalisations and false analogies . in addition , the role of culture in influencing and perhaps determining some aspects of linguistic behaviour is discussed , for example , how native speakers might " gate " a non-native speaker . error gravity and comprehensibility are also covered , as are some amusing examples given for " the irritation factor " . the sociopragmatic consequences of error production in social situations , and the potentially negative outcomes for non-native speakers , are also discussed . chapter 8 discusses pragmatic strategies for using ea to correct errors in speech and writing for second language learners . these are enhanced by a number of case studies presented in chapter 9 . the issues covered in these last two chapters are non-trivial for applied linguistics : is second - language teaching effective ? if so , which approaches are best suited to particular kinds of students ? are formal / grammatical or informal / conversational approaches superior ? although james provides no magic answers for any of these questions , he does present a coherent methodology for answering these kinds of questions for individual situations , which is the great appeal of this book . this book would be suitable as an undergraduate or graduate text in applied linguistics or tesl programmes , but will be an invaluable reference for researchers in related fields such as psycholinguistics and machine translation , who might be searching for a more formal methodology for understanding error production in their respective fields . this book will be an indispensable addition to every linguist 's library . reviewed by : paul a . watters , department of computing , school of mathematics , physics , computing and electronics , macquarie university nsw 2109 , australia . tel . : + 61 -

<subject> towards culturally situated agents </subject> * * * call for papers and participation * * * issues in cross cultural communication " towards culturally situated agents " http : / / www . nttmsc . com . my / kido / pricai98cfp . html 24th of november 1998 , singapore introduction culture underlies every aspect of social behavior and influences communication style , personality , character , motivation , knowledge and cognition . there is an extensive body of work on cross-cultural differences in communication styles in the linguistics and cultural anthropology literature . in the intelligent user interface design community , over the years , fueled by the recognition that different types of users are motivated by different needs and goals , attention has been given to the development of adaptive user interfaces . however , this line of research and development has given little consideration to the influence that culture plays in shaping what users want out of the computational experience . in order to create interfaces that accommodate different user styles , therefore , it is important to understand these cultural influences , since , in many cases , a user will react to interfaces on the basis of cultural background . similarly , if we are to view an agent , software or robot as a social member of a " cyber society , " then that agent must be able to invoke cultural knowledge in order to communicate flexibly with human users and possibly other agents . if agents are reflective only of their designers ' communicative behaviors and are not able to adapt to the styles of other agents which they meet in heterogeneous , distributed environments and virtual reality worlds , then our agents may be trapped in a tower of babel . the goal of this workshop is to discuss cultural influences as they ( may ) inform interactions among human and software agents . this workshop is intended to attract participants from those communities concerned with such a perspective of communication . topics of interest the workshop aims to be interdisciplinary in nature and is therefore open to contributions from various research fields . the topics which the workshop addresses are relevant , for instance , in : anthropology , sociology , sociolinguistics , human computer interaction ( hci ) , cscw , machine learning , adaptive systems research , collaborative virtual environments , multi-media multi-user environments , ethnology , social sciences , psychology and cognitive science . the scope of this workshop includes , but need not be restricted to the following topics : * the nature of cross cultural communication , including case studies and examples * the origin and evolution of communication * linguistic and ethnographic studies of cross cultural communication * negotiation strategies among humans from different cultural backgrounds * negotiation strategies among agents informed by different cultural principles * user interfaces and new media for cross cultural communication * the impact of internet technology on cross cultural communication * culturally situated metaphors in interface , machine and agent design * ethnomethodology in interface and agent design * culturally dependent metaphors and language of describing and talking about humans , machines and agents : influences on the design process , theory / model building , and scientific experimentation * case studies of program execution problems due to agent to agent and human to agent miscommunication * standards which are open to the development of multiple ontologies of mult iagent communication in heterogeneous environments * working examples of culturally adaptive agents in multiagent or human-agent systems papers should address these topics in the context of how they relate to issues in agent design and agent behavior . participation and submission of papers the workshop will comprise a few keynote talks , a panel discussion with participants from different research areas and presentations of preliminary findings by workshop participants . participants will be selected by the organizing committee ( see below ) based on submitted papers . potential participants who wish to present their work at the workshop should submit a short paper ( up to 5 , 000 words ) or extended abstract ( 1 , 500 to 2 , 500 words ) . contributions should describe work in progress , completed work , positions , or give significant insight into the issues on cross cultural communication . other potential participants should send a statement of interest ( one page ) , briefly describing their work and their interest in the workshop . some of the participants will be asked to contribute a paper to the final working notes . all participants will be invited to bring a poster presenting their work . submissions should be sent by e-mail ( ascii , unix compatible postscript , or rtf ) to the workshop chair , takashi kido ,

<subject> syllable structure and gesture timing </subject> call for papers : syllable stucture and gesture timing as part of the conference lp ' 98 to be held at ohio state university sept . 15-20 , there will be a workshop funded by the national science foundation sept . 19-20 , on ' syllable structure and gesture timing ' , covering issues related to phonetic and phonological accounts of segmentation , and timing and ordering of gestures in speech , especially how sequences of consonants e . g . [ spr ] , [ ntw ] are formally represented . speech is traditionally represented as a string of segments , defined in terms of features which are implemented simultaneously . in that conception , the phoneme is the minimal phonological unit where time and ordering are defined . as has long been known , the transition from phoneme to phoneme is phonetically realized as a continuous change . there has been a steady progression in phonological theory from linear generative theory to nonlinear representations where the mapping between segments and features is quite relaxed , and highly articulated suprasegmental structures are assumed . a consequence of nonlinear models , which allow single 's egments ' to bear multiple values of a feature and allow one feature to be associated with many 's egments ' , is that one can meaningfully question the existence of the 's egment ' as a formal object . the theory of feature geometry does not explicitly represent the notion 's egment ' , and it has been argued that the traditional segment does not correspond to any specific level of representation in current models . nonlinear models have increasingly tended towards positing complex but internally timeless single 's egments ' in place of clusters of segments : thus , what was formerly represented as a triconsonantal sequence [ ntw ] might also be represented as a single segment , a ' voiceless prenasalised rounded alveolar ' . some languages , such as bella coola and georgian , seem to allow unbounded arbitrary sequences of consonants , which suggests that phonological theory may ultimately need to allow infinitely long syllables and unstructured onsets and codas . one of the central questions to be taken up in the workshop is " are there any universal limits on possible strings of segments in various positions within the syllable " ? this statement of the question begs two quite important questions : do segments per se exist ( and how can one identify whether a given temporal stretch of the phonetic output corresponds to one or more segments ) , and do syllables themselves exist ? both of these assumptions remain controversial , especially in nonlinear phonology . invited speakers for this workshop include donca steriade , john ohala , john harris and louis goldstein . further details on the issues being investigated in this workshop can be found at http : / / ling . ohio-state . edu / events / phon _ workshop . html . one - page abstracts for 30 minute papers to be presented at this workshop are solicited ( due date for receipt of abstracts : august 10 ) . lodging and up to $ 400 to cover economy travel expenses will be provided to authors presenting papers at the workshop . abstracts may be sent by email to odden @ ling . ohio-state . edu , or by surface mail to : syllable workshop department of linguistics ohio state university columbus , oh 43210 please include a surface mail address , email address , and phone number .
<subject> stylistics </subject> joanna thornborrow and shan wareing , patterns in language an introduction to language and literary style patterns in language addresses the real needs of students who may not have an extensive background either in traditional literature or in linguistic theory . this student-friendly textbook uses the principles of linguistic analysis to investigate the aesthetic use of language in literary ( and non-literary ) texts . written in straightforward , accessible language with imaginative examples and a humorous tone , it shows how linguistic knowledge can enhance and enrich the analysis of texts . the authors borrow from traditional stylistics , but focus primarily on the recurring linguistic patterns which are used by writers of poetry , fiction and drama . the authors draw on a wide variety of textual sources to illustrate their observations , making reference to both canonical literature and modern literary texts , as well as to popular fiction , television and the language of advertising . exercises designed to develop the students ' understanding of the material are provided at every stage , and sample answers are also included . interface routledge : 1998 : 280 pp cl : 0 415 14063 3 : # d5081 : $ 65 . 00 pb : 0 415 14064 1 : # d5085 : $ 20 . 99 jonathan culpepper , peter verdonk , and mick short , eds . , exploring the language of drama from text to context focusing on the characterization of speech as a form of action , exploring the language of drama introduces students to the stylistic analysis of drama . here , some of the world 's leading scholars demonstrate the importance of analyzing the text of drama rather than focusing on performance , presenting their approaches in an engaging and accessible style . the essays employ techniques from language analysis ( specifically discourse analysis , cognitive linguistics and pragmatic ) to explore the language of plays , looking at how different theories and approaches can be used to help us understand characterization in dialogue , the cognitive patterns that support the narrative and discourse of drama , and the basic mechanisms of conversation in dramatic dialogue . each chapter ends in a summary with follow-up exercises , and offers practical advice on how to analyze a play extract and write it up as an assignment . interface routledge : 1998 : 192 pp cl : 0 415 13794 2 : # d5353 : $ 65 . 00 pb : 0 415 13795 0 : # d5357 : $ 20 . 99

<subject> linguistic theory </subject> dominique sportiche , partitions and atoms of clause structure subjects , agreement , case and clitics this collection builds on the theory of principles and parameters and its economy - - minimalist descendants . the essays progressively develop a view of syntactic structures in which syntactic properties are increasingly analyzed as atomized in progressively smaller elementary components and partitioned in the way these elementary components are represented . dominique sportiche argues that as a consequence of this view , languages do not differ at all in their syntactic organization . routledge leading linguists routledge : 1998 : 448 pp cl : 0 415 16926 7 : # d4946 : $ 110 . 00 laura a . michaelis , aspectual grammar and past time reference this work examines the linguistic constructions which speakers use to talk about events that occurred in the past and states which held in the past . laura michaelis argues that the fundamental conceptual division between events and states forms the basis of systems of verbal aspect in all languages , and that one cannot talk about the meaning of a past-tense assertion without making reference to the event-state distinction . focusing on english data , the author examines the semantic and functional overlap between assertions about the past and assertions involving events : when one asserts that an event of a given kind exists , one is making an assertion about the past . this semantic overlap can be evoked as a way of characterizing the close relationship between the past-tense construction and the past-perfect construction : while a past tense assertion like she left is used to describe the past , a present-perfect assertion like she has left is used to assert the existence of an event by invoking its aftermath ( her absence ) . dr . michaelis argues that the two constructions are semantically equivalent , but distinguished by their function in narrative . this study presents a semantic framework for analyzing all aspectual constructions in terms of the event-state distinction , and describes the grammatical expression of aspectual meaning in terms of a theory of grammatical constructions . in this theory , grammatical constructions , like words , are conventionalized form-meaning pairs , which are best described not only with respect to their intrinsic semantic values , but also with respect to the functional opposition in which they participate . michaelis argues that many of the otherwise puzzling grammatical constraints which characterize the english present-perfect construction can be motivated in terms of the functional opposition between present perfect and past tense . routledge studies in germanic linguistics 4 routledge : 1998 : 320 pp cl : 0 415 15678 5 : # d4385 : $ 90 . 00 asa kasher , ed , pragmatics 6 volume set the purpose of this collection is to portray the development of pragmatics as a science of language , in a such a way as to enable readers to critically assess this theorectical development . issues explored include * presupposition * implicature * discourse * grammar * communication * indexicals * psychology * sociology . this work provides highly useful references and suggestions for further reading , and has an exceptionally detailed subject and name index to enable easy and immediate access for the reader . critical concepts routledge : 1998 : 2653 pp cl : 0 415 11734 8 : # d2960 : $ 905 . 00 for more information on these and other titles from : routledge london * new york in north america : www . routledge-ny . com elsewhere : www . routledge . com

<subject> complexity in language contact , acquisition and change </subject> newsletter 1 . workshop on complexity in language contact , acquisition and change . 8 september 1998 , paris , france . in colaboration with the cnrs ( centre national de recherche scientifique ) , the lot ( netherlands graduate school of linguistics ) is organizing some workshops to create a forum to encourage the discussion between researchers in linguistics from the netherlands and france . one of the workshops is initiated by members of the university of amsterdam and has as its subject : complexity in language contact , acquisition and change . the workshop will take place on tuesday the 8th of september , starting at 14 . 30 until approximately 20 . 00h . the theme although there is a kind of dogma that all natural languages are equally complex , at least for certain subsystems of language there may well be differences in complexity . in discussions of processes of language change and first and second language acquisition the notion of complexity plays an important role . especially in creole studies simplicity and complexity implicitly have been dominant issues in the debate , but are seldom properly scrutinized . in this workshop we want to discuss the role of complexity in these domains , including grammatical theory , first and second language acquisition , language change and language contact - in order to shed light on controversial problems invoked by the term complexity in linguistics in general . the structure of the workshop the workshop is organized around three themes : creole languages , language acquisition and language change . each theme will be discussed by researchers from france and the netherlands in 10 minutes presentations , inspired by the following propositions . after these short presentations there will be time for discussion in each session . 1 . all languages have the same " costs / payment " balance , i . e . if a language becomes phonologically more simple , its morphological system will become more complex . [ cf . haugen 1976 : 286 ] 2 . all complexity in languages resides in the lexicon . [ cf . aronoff 1995 ] 3 . languages spoken within small communities are more complex than languages of large communities . [ cf . whinnom 1980 , hymes 1971 , mhlhusler 1996 ] 4 . language shift will in general lead to simplification , while borrowing will lead generally to more complex structures . [ cf . thomason & kaufman 1988 ] 5 . complexity does not play a role in first language acquisition , but it does in second language acquisition . [ cf . trudgill 1992 ] 6 . grammaticalization leads to greater complexity .
