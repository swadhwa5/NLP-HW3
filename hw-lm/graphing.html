<h1>Graphing Tips</h1>

<p>To include a graph in your writeup, just include an image of it
(perhaps a screenshot) in your PDF.</p>

<!-- <p>To include a graph in your writeup, just give us instructions about
how to view it on the ugrad machines (e.g., <code>xgraph
mydata.txt</code> or <code>display myplot.png</code>).</p> -->

<p>You can make the graphs however you like---including using a
spreadsheet, or R, or Matlab.</p>

<p>Here's a quick way to make a line graph from Python:</p>
<pre>
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot(3,5,'b.')               # a blue dot
plt.plot(4,-1,'b.')              # another blue dot
plt.plot([7,8,9],[9,8,7],'rx')   # three red x's
plt.show()
</pre>
There's lots more information about matplotlib and pyplot online.

<p>Alternatively, you may find the xgraph utility useful; it is very
easy to use.  A more powerful choice would be gnuplot.  Both are
described below.</p>

<p><i>Some of the material below is adapted from Jason Baldridge at UT
Austin.</i></p>

<h4>Remote Graphics</h4>

<p>If you are working on your own Linux machine, you should be able to
run graphical programs on one of the ugrad machines if you connect to
it using the
<code>-Y</code> option: e.g., <code>ssh
    -Y <i>USERNAME</i>@ugrad12.cs.jhu.edu</code>.  This option allows
    remote programs on <code>ugrad12</code> to open windows on your
    local X Window desktop and send graphics back to them.</p>

<p>If you are working on your own Windows machine, you can 
<A HREF="http://taggi.cse.unsw.edu.au/FAQ/Accessing_CSE_login_servers/#Logging_in_from_Windows">use
  PuTTY and Xming</A> to accomplish the same thing.</p>

<p>Remote graphics over X is painfully slow, however.  So you may
    prefer to work directly on one of the ugrad machines (in
    <A HREF="https://support.cs.jhu.edu/wiki/Obtaining_Access_To_The_CS_Computer_Labs">Malone
    122 / Malone G-61</A>) or install graphing programs on your own
    machine.</p>

<h4>xgraph</h4>

<p>xgraph provides a simple way to create line graphs and scatter
plots.  The original version
is <A HREF="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~radford/xgraph.html">here</A>
and is already installed on the ugrad machines, where you can
type <code>man xgraph</code> for documentation.  Alternatively, I
think the version
at <a href="http://www.xgraph.org/">www.xgraph.org</a> is a
later version of the same program and is available as an Ubuntu
package called <code>xgraph</code>.</p>

<p>The following text file specifies a graph:</p>
<blockquote><pre>
TitleText: Sample Data

"Plot one"
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
5 6

"Plot two"
1 1
2 4
3 9
4 16
5 25

"Plot three"
1 10
2 8
3 6
4 4
5 2
</pre></blockquote>

<p>This should be pretty self-explanatory: there are three different
relationships being plotted.  We can optionally name each graph by
putting a string in quotes along with the block giving the data. The
first column gives x values, the second gives y values.</p>

<p>If the above text is in a file called <code>mydata.txt</code>, you can
  view the graph with the command</p>
<blockquote><pre>
xgraph mydata.txt
</pre></blockquote>

<p>If the above text is printed by your program <tt>myscript</tt>,
  you can view the graph with the command</p>
<blockquote><pre>
myscript | xgraph
</pre></blockquote>

<p>Use <code>xgraph -P</code> instead of <code>xgraph</code> if you
  just want to plot the points and not connect them with lines.  There
  are other options, such as logarithmic plots.</p>

<h4>gnuplot</h4>

<p>A more powerful alternative is gnuplot.  It's available from
<A HREF="http://gnuplot.info">gnuplot.info</A> or as the
Ubuntu package <code>gnuplot</code>, and is already installed on the
ugrad machines.

<p>Let's start by creating two
data files
<code>numbers1.dat</code> and <code>numbers2.dat</code>:</p>
<blockquote><pre>
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
5 6
</pre></blockquote>

<blockquote><pre>
1 1
2 4
3 9
4 16
5 25
</pre></blockquote>

<p>Again, the two columns correspond to x and y coordinates of some
points.  The following gnuplot commands will plot the data along with
a function:
<blockquote><pre>
set xlabel 'My X-axis label'
set ylabel 'My Y-axis label'
plot 'numbers1.dat' title 'linear', \
     'numbers2.dat' title 'squared' with l, \
     sin(x)**2 title 'sinsquared'
</pre></blockquote>
The modifier <code>with l</code> says to connect the points with lines.

<p>You can start gnuplot and enter these commands interactively, or you
can put the commands in a file <code>mycommands.txt</code> and type
<blockquote><pre>
gnuplot -persist mycommands.txt
</pre></blockquote>
Or you can pipe the commands into gnuplot:
<blockquote><pre>
myscript | gnuplot -persist
</pre></blockquote>
</p>

<p>The <code>-persist</code> option keeps the graph window open after
the gnuplot session ends.  Alternatively, you can dump the graph to
a PNG file (for example) by including these gnuplot commands:
<blockquote><pre>
set term png
set output "myplot.png"
</pre></blockquote>
Make sure to use those commands before plotting, or else type
<code>replot</code> after you use them.</p>

<p>You can then view the PNG file with any of various commands such
as <code>display</code>, <code>eog</code>, or
even <code>firefox</code>.  Running the PNG viewer remotely will be
slow, so you may want to pull it down to your local machine first:
<blockquote><code>
scp <i>USERNAME</i>@ugrad12.cs.jhu.edu:myplot.png .
display myplot.png
</code></blockquote>
The Windows alternative to <code>scp</code> is <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html">PSCP</a>.
